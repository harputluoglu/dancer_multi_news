in 'SNL' parody of 'Meet the Parents' Trump order targets wide swath of public assistance programs Comey says Trump reacted to news of Russian meddling by asking if it changed election results MORE lands in Washington overnight Saturday he arrives to a slew of controversies besieging his administration It may be a rude awakening after what Trump called a home run of a trip      The White House has remained largely quiet on controversies swirling at home and will likely seek to emphasize the president's traveling successes in coming days Trump and his aides hope to take a victory lap over his first overseas trip — a sweeping nine-day excursion through five different countries across the Middle East and Europe      In Saudi Arabia, the president's first stop abroad, Trump secured a massive arms sale, worth about $110 billion      ADVERTISEMENT      In Jerusalem, he shored up the United States' relationship with Israel and reaffirmed his commitment to Middle East peacemaking      And in Brussels, Trump ratcheted up his call for NATO members to bolster their defense spending in order to meet their treaty obligations      Here are five takeaways from the president's tumultuous trip      Trump took a softer tone on Islam      Trump moved away from his once-strident rhetoric on Islam during an address in Riyadh to leaders across the Muslim world last Sunday, calling instead for unity in the fight against Islamist extremism      This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects or different civilizations, Trump said This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life and decent people, all in the name of religion, people that want to protect life and want to protect their religion This is a battle between good and evil      Not once in his speech did Trump revert to his once-frequent use of the phrase radical Islamic terrorism to describe the extremist groups and militants he has vowed to combat      But he also called on Muslim leaders to drive out the terrorists and extremists from their societies, and urged them to do more to combat extremist ideologies in the Muslim world      He reaffirmed support for Israel and pressed for Middle East peace      The president arrived in Israel amid revelations that he had divulged highly classified intelligence provided by the key ally to Russian officials But Trump quickly managed to ease the controversy and reaffirm U.S support for Israel Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raved on Twitter about Trump's taking such a strong stand for Israel and the Jewish people      Trump paid a solemn visit to the Western Wall in East Jerusalem, where he stayed for a moment of silence before placing a note between the wall's stones It was the first trip to the wall by a sitting president, though other presidents have visited the holy site either before or after leaving the White House      But he also expressed the hope of making peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and never declared his intention to move the U.S embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem — a move that would be certain to anger Palestinians, please Israel and complicate peacemaking      I’ve heard it’s one of the toughest deals in the world,” he said, referring to Middle East peacemaking But I’m sure we’re going to get there eventually      Trump berated NATO over defense spending      Trump's America first approach to foreign policy was on full display in Brussels when the president addressed a gathering of fellow NATO members at the organization's headquarters in Belgium      At the heart of his speech was his assertion that the U.S is shouldering an unfair burden of NATO's defense costs, and that member countries must spend at least two percent of their GDP on defense, a target that all members agreed on in 2014 Currently, only five NATO countries meet that spending target      This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States, he said, speaking directly to the world leaders during a ceremony in Brussels And many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years      The complaint that other countries aren't doing enough to provide for their own defense is one that Trump frequently touted on the campaign trail      But after a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg last month, Trump pivoted on his claim that the treaty organization is obsolete, leading some to question whether the president would take an approach to NATO more typical of past presidents      Nevertheless, in his address to NATO leaders, Trump refused to reaffirm U.S support for the organization's principle of mutual defense, and failed to address growing European concern over Russia's intentions in the region      He declined to pledge support for the Paris climate agreement      Trump refused to join Group of Seven (G7) leaders on Saturday in taking a pledge to support the Paris climate deal, leaving it unclear as to whether the U.S will remain part of the agreement      If the U.S withdraws, as Trump has floated in the past, it would be the first to do so among the 195 countries that have agreed to the deal Trump's decision not to take the pledge further highlighted a stark division between the U.S and its allies on the issue of climate change      But as a presidential candidate, Trump campaigned on bolstering American fossil fuels, particularly the coal industry      Still, the president's aides left open the possibility of Trump sticking to the climate agreement, saying that his views on the issue are evolving as he speaks to other leaders about it      “I think his views are evolving,” National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn Gary Davivd CohnTop Trump security adviser Tom Bossert resigning BET co-founder credits Trump tax cut with bringing black workers back into labor force What happened to the ‘best and most serious people’?

(Associated Press)      In this May 26, 2017, photo, leaders of the G7, from left, European Council President Donald Tusk, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, U.S President Donald J Trump, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, Japan's Prime Minister.. (Associated Press)      TAORMINA, Sicily (AP) — As he dashed through the Middle East and Europe, Donald Trump looked like a conventional American leader abroad He solemnly laid a wreath at a Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, had an audience with the pope at the Vatican and stood center stage with Western allies at the annual summits that dominate the diplomatic calendar      But when Trump spoke, he sounded like anything but a typical U.S president      On his first overseas tour, the new president made no attempt to publicly promote democracy and human rights in Saudi Arabia, instead declaring that he wasn't there to lecture In Israel and the West Bank, he pointedly did not back America's long-standing support for a two-state solution to the intractable peace process And in the heart of Europe, Trump berated NATO allies over their financial commitments and would not explicitly endorse the one for all, all for one defense doctrine that has been the cornerstone of trans-Atlantic security for decades      To the White House, Trump's first trip abroad was an embodiment of the promises he made as a candidate to put America's interests first and break through the guardrails that have long defined U.S foreign policy Trump advisers repeatedly described the trip as historic and groundbreaking, including one senior official who brashly said without evidence that Trump had united the entire Muslim world      Addressing U.S troops Saturday at a Sicilian air base moments before departing for Washington, Trump himself declared: I think we hit a home run      Trump boarded Air Force One without having held a single news conference on the trip — a break in presidential precedent that allowed him to avoid facing tough questions about his foreign policy or the raging controversies involving the investigations into his campaign's possible ties to Russia Instead, the White House hoped to let the images of Trump in statesman-like settings tell the story of his first trip abroad, and perhaps ease questions about his preparedness for the delicate world of international diplomacy      Yet those questions are sure to persist, particularly given Trump's remarkable lashing of NATO allies in Brussels Standing alongside his counterparts, the president effectively accused countries who do not meet NATO's goal of spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product of sponging off American taxpayers He left some allies, already nervous about Russia's saber-rattling and Trump's public affection for Russian President Vladimir Putin, further flummoxed when he ended his remarks without making an explicit statement of support for Article 5, the common defense clause that underpins the 68-year-old military alliance      The mood of Article 5, the idea that we are all in this together, is not the mood he conveyed, said Jon Alterman, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington The mood he conveyed is you guys are a bunch of freeloaders      Some European leaders believe Trump can still be coaxed away from his controversial campaign positions At the Group of 7 summit in the coastal town of Taormina, leaders launched an aggressive, behind-the-scenes campaign to get him to stay in the Paris climate accord      While Trump emerged from the summit without a final decision on the Paris pact, he declared in a tweet Saturday that he will make a final decision next week      Trump's return home Saturday night also shifts attention back to the storm clouds of scandal hovering over the White House In a briefing with reporters Saturday, White House officials shifted uncomfortably and refused to comment when asked about reports that Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, tried to set up secret communications with Russia after the election      Trump's nine-day, five-stop international tour resulted in few tangible policy achievements The U.S inked a $110 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia and unveiled numerous business commitments in the region, though the White House never provided specific details about the scope of the agreements At NATO, the White House touted the alliance's commitment to boosting defense spending, though the resolution was essentially a continuation of a pact agreed to two years earlier      Still, the trip offered the clearest picture to date of how Trump plans to put his imprint on America's relationship with the world      From the start, he set a new direction Instead of following presidential tradition by making his international debut in a neighboring democracy like Canada or Mexico, Trump flew to Saudi Arabia, the repressive desert kingdom      He appeared particularly comfortable in the setting In Riyadh, he received a lavish, gold-plated welcome: His image was projected across the facade of the luxury hotel where he stayed, horses flanked his motorcade as it moved to one of the king's desert palaces and an extravagant celebration was held in his honor, complete with a traditional Saudi sword dance      Trump betrayed no awkwardness at relishing the warm embrace of one of the world's most oppressive governments Instead, he reciprocated with a pledge to not publicly chastise the ruling royal family for its crackdown on political dissent      We are not here to lecture — we are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship, Trump said      Trump was lavishly feted in Israel as well, embraced by a prime minister who despised his predecessor and was eager to flatter the new president Trump received multiple standing ovations — one of his favorite measures of success — during a speech on U.S relations with Israel The photo of his solemn visit to the Western Wall was splashed across the front pages of Israel's newspapers      Like many of his predecessors, Trump made a personal appeal for peace between Israelis and Palestinians But he never uttered the words two-state solution, the longtime U.S policy plan that would create a separate homeland for Palestinians He also made no mention of new Jewish settlements in the West Bank, a major point of contention for the Palestinians      The smaller moments of the president's trip were endlessly dissected as well, from first lady Melania Trump's apparent reluctance to hold her husband's hand on occasion to his shoving aside of Montenegro's prime minister to get to the front of a pack of leaders at a NATO photo opportunity At the G-7, it was Trump's interactions with other leaders that commanded attention      The six other heads of state took a short walk from one event to the next, chatting convivially as they strolled through the narrow Sicilian streets Trump hung back, deciding against joining his peers      Instead, he got in a golf cart and the American president's mini-motorcade drove the route alone, Trump once more having charted his own course      ___      Follow Julie Pace

suit jacket He sometimes seemed unsure whether to smile his toothy grin or glare, as he does when posing for portraits, so he alternated At formal events, Trump did not always know where to go or what to do      “What is the protocol?” he asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as they walked down a red carpet at an airport arrival ceremony in Tel Aviv      “Who knows?” Netanyahu replied “I think they’ll just tell us where to stand.”      Trump was visibly comfortable in environs that evoked his own, such as Saudi Arabia’s gilded-and-chandeliered palaces, yet appeared out of place in others He arrived like a wrecking ball at the new NATO headquarters, a glass-and-steel behemoth that stands as a symbol of globalism and ­bureaucracy      Trump’s family members took center stage Daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, both White House advisers, stood behind or next to the president when he delivered his speech to Muslim leaders, prayed at the Western Wall, addressed Israeli-Palestinian peace and met the pope They peeled off from the trip in Rome, midway through      First lady Melania Trump was omnipresent, although largely silent and emotionless She and her husband were rarely seen exchanging words, and he sometimes walked ahead of her, almost as if she were an ornament      But the first lady came out of her shell at solo events, handing out Dr Seuss books and coloring with children She was especially moved by her visit to Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital in Rome, where she read a book to and held hands with a boy who was awaiting a heart transplant A few hours later, the first lady learned that the hospital had found a donor “Receiving that news is a moment I will never forget,” she said      (The Washington Post)      A Slovenian-born former model, Melania received considerable attention for her fashion The Saudi media fawned over her attire in Riyadh as “conservative” and “classy,” although she raised eyebrows

trade to climate change and migration      “A president becomes presidential,” said Fred Davis, a Republican media strategist “I’m hoping this trip brings him a level of personal peace, confidence and gravitas that he can use back home.”      In Saudi Arabia, Trump’s call for cooperation in the fight against the Islamic State unquestionably pushed the issue forward, with renewed emphasis on stopping terrorism financing and blocking militant messaging and recruitment Beyond any substantive accomplishment, Trump revitalized Arab leaders, particularly in the Persian Gulf, who felt they had been disrespected and ignored by President Barack Obama      “The United States shifted over the last eight years as a neutral player, at best, that looked the other way at Iranian aggression around the world,” said Ari ­Fleischer, a White House press secretary under former president George W Bush “We are now where we should be.”      In Israel and on the West Bank, Trump repeated his pledge to bring Israelis and Palestinians together in a peace deal, although no progress was made on starting that process He delighted Netanyahu, and probably discouraged Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, by not mentioning a two-state solution as a goal      [Amid a chillier welcome in Europe, Trump keeps pining for Saudi Arabia]      In Europe, Trump’s badgering remarks on defense spending — during a NATO ceremony memorializing the joint alliance response to the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks — left a bad taste There was widespread disappointment at Trump’s failure to use the occasion to reaffirm the U.S commitment to the alliance’s joint defense pact, Article 5, although national security adviser H.R McMaster said that “of course” Trump supports it      Trump’s behavior, said Stefan Leifert of Germany’s public broadcaster ZDF, was “a slap in the face of all other alliance members.”      But there were also positive reactions Germany’s Die Welt newspaper commentator Christoph B Schiltz wrote that Trump’s “urging, his bugging and his persistence have left the alliance finally engaging more in the fight against international terrorism.”      The White House appeared to step on its own media applause lines by failing to provide timely fact sheets or copies of signed agreements Trump was touting in public as “historic” and “epic.” Media spokesmen sometimes were ill-equipped to provide basic information And unlike virtually every president on similar journeys, Trump held no news ­conferences      On the campaign trail, as Trump assessed Obama’s foreign policy, he fixated on an image from China that he thought symbolized America’s declining power: Obama disembarking Air Force One in Hangzhou, where he was attending a Group of 20 summit, on a metal ladder extending from the plane’s belly      “They have pictures of other leaders who are    coming down with a beautiful red carpet And Obama is coming down a metal staircase,” Trump said at a stop in Ohio “If that were me I would say, ‘You know what, folks, I respect you a lot but close the doors, let’s get out of here.’ ”      Trump did not have to make that call on this trip At each stop there were better-than- satisfactory staircases from which he could descend At the Riyadh airport, trumpets blared, soldiers stood at attention, fighter jets flew overhead and a spotless red carpet stretched across the tarmac The aging King Salman, arriving in a golf cart and aided by a cane, warmly greeted the president at the foot of the staircase      “It was very spectacular,” Trump later told European leaders, using his characteristic hyperbole to describe his welcome in Saudi Arabia “I don’t think there was ever anything like that That was beyond anything anyone’s seen.”      [What scandal?

{"article_number": 878, "article_idx": 3, "article_text": " Taormina, Italy (CNN) Swinging over the green Ionian sea Saturday, his first foreign trip behind him, President Donald Trump was in a valedictory mood       Behind him, perched on the hillside, was the former Dominican monastery where G7 leaders had just finishing haranguing him to abandon his campaign promises to withdraw from a major climate agreement He didn't give in      Ahead was a crowd of US troops stationed on this rocky Italian outpost, eager to hear their commander in chief reprise the foreign agenda he'd spend the last nine days considering      After nine days of talks with calculating foreign leaders, Trump was eager for the affirmation of an applauding audience      We have been gone for a long time, Trump declared at the Sigonella Air Base here Everywhere I go -- we have been gone close to nine days, this will be nine days -- I think we hit a home run no matter where we are      It was an upbeat message for a leader fresh from meeting with his new club of foreign counterparts for the first time But underneath the point-by-point recap of his trip lay uncertainty over his agenda and disputes with his foreign counterparts      Trump's first voyage abroad was a story told in chapters, each successively less pleasant for a President still taking stock of his standing on the world stage      Beyond a scattering of formal remarks, none of the story was told by Trump himself, who refused to hold a news conference and, by his advisers' own admission, revealed little of his thinking to top aides as he hopped from nation to nation      Instead, it was a trip told in pictures with the volume on mute  By the time he departed Sicily, Trump had delivered four major addresses but clarified none of the questions that surround his foreign policy      In some ways, uncertainty amounted to a win, at least in the minds of Trump's aides As Trump prepared to depart Washington last Friday, there was little surety among his staff that the nine-day odyssey could proceed without failure Trump himself, who hadn't slept in a bed that wasn't his own since taking office, remained skeptical a five-country itinerary could end well      A homebody with little appetite for discomfort, Trump was imagining the worst Unpleasant foreign food, withering jet lag, and an unfamiliar bed had been his experiences as a businessman abroad Even in the days leading up to his departure, Trump asked whether the trip could be truncated He vented about the ambitious schedule to his senior advisers in the days leading up to his departure      But by then it was too late With meetings locked in and the world anticipating his global debut, Trump settled into his quarters on Air Force One for a flight four times longer than any he'd taken as President      JUST WATCHED President Trump receives Saudi gold medal Replay More Videos ..

bands and a military jet flyover, Trump wasn't in a conciliatory mood While he vowed in Riyadh the US would no longer lecture its allies -- particularly on human rights -- it was a lecture he delivered during an unveiling ceremony at the military alliance's new building      Twenty-three of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they're supposed to be paying for their defense, Trump said as his fellow NATO leaders openly scoffed This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States And many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years      Trump's message didn't contain an explicit endorsement of NATO's collective defense pact -- an attack on one is an attack on all -- though his aides later insisted the message was implied      As he mingled at his first major summit of world leaders, it was evident the new member of the exclusive society wasn't out to make friends He

Sicily: “I think we hit a home run.”      But aside from closing a $110 billion weapons deal with Saudi Arabia on the first day of his nine-day tour, it wasn’t entirely clear what concrete goals the president achieved      Story Continued Below      Trump made it through the grueling trip without a major diplomatic incident—despite a close call in Israel, where he volunteered to reporters that he’d never uttered the country’s name as the source of intelligence he reportedly shared with Russian officials during an Oval Office visit      And he succeeded in putting off allies who were pressuring him to keep the U.S in the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord, buying himself the space to make a diplomatically awkward decision that will please his base at home      Now, Trump returns home to deepening scandals related to his aides’ ties to Russia, having shown his ability to represent the U.S on the world stage in true Trump fashion      Here are POLITICO’S five takeaways after traveling with the president through five stops:      Trump prefers one-on-one meetings to big multilateral summits      Trump seemed to enjoy the first leg of his trip, with visits to Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Vatican His time in Saudi Arabia was dominated by a celebration in a gilded palace where Trump mingled among royalty Along with the dealmaking in Saudi, the first half of the tour was dominated by talk about security and terrorism, both favorite Trump topics      But in Brussels and Sicily, Trump found counterparts who were largely unified against him—and decided not to give them what they wanted, whether it was a public commitment to NATO’s mutual defense clause or assent to staying in the Paris climate deal      The most reliable politics newsletter Sign up for POLITICO

optics were the message      Trump glowed as he placed his hands on an illuminated orb alongside King Salman at the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology in Saudi Arabia on Sunday At the Western Wall in Jerusalem, Trump was reverent and peaceful as he touched the wall with a yarmulke on his head At the Vatican, Trump grinned alongside his black-clad wife and daughter while Pope Francis glowered      In Europe, Trump had more awkward encounters that telegraphed his attitude The photo of him tightly gripping the hand of French President Emmanuel Macron and video of him appearing to push past the prime minister of Montenegro out of his way made headlines At the G7 summit family photo, German Chancellor Angela Merkel looked away while standing next to Trump, who was looking down      Trump’s ‘home-run’ accomplished very little – perhaps by design      Privately, some U.S officials called the jaunt “completely useless.” Very few decisions were made in the summit meetings, while Trump played to his base with an America First” approach to foreign relations But the president got away without making any promises that would be hard to keep back in Washington—and managed to reverse positions taken by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, without causing major diplomatic rows      EU Council President Donald Tusk called this weekend’s gathering “the most difficult G7 summit,” because Trump arrived seeking to reverse prior positions held by the United States Co-signers, desperate to keep the agreement together, have privately accepted that they may have to higher emissions levels for the U.S to keep them in the pact, which Trump could eventually tout as a win, according to a U.S diplomat      The end result for the G7 was a watered-down communiqué, in which six of the seven members reaffirmed their “strong commitment” to the Paris accord on climate change Trump has said he’ll make a final decision as soon as next week      But Trump finally took a position on Russia      While the G7 allies weren’t able to nail down Trump’s stance on the Paris climate accord, they did get some more clarity on the administration’s position concerning sanctions against Russia      Chief economic adviser Gary Cohn initially suggested in Brussels that the White House didn’t yet have a position on sanctions stemming from Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, but then told reporters on Friday, “We’re not lowering our sanctions on Russia If anything, we would probably look to get tougher on Russia.”      The final G7 communiqué maintained a hard line on Russia      Trump hoped for a reset, but at least he got to avoid his trouble at home for a week      President Donald Trump did not give a single press conference on the trip, breaking with tradition of speaking with reporters during major trips to promote the White House narrative      While the other six leaders that attended the G7 summit held press conferences Saturday at the conclusion of the event, Trump took off for a U.S naval base, where he thanked his wife, Melania, for joining him, and touted his “truly historic week.”       ", "summary": "– \"I

Republic) — The Central African Republic's president said Thursday he was negotiating the surrender of wanted Ugandan militia boss Joseph Kony but Washington dismissed the claims      The announcement had raised hopes that Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army were on their last legs, but US officials quickly moved to describe reports the rebel leader himself was involved in surrender talks as not credible      It's true, Joseph Kony wants to come out of the bush We are negotiating with him, Michel Djotodia said during a meeting with political leaders in the capital Bangui      He asked for food supplies and the government took care of that, the Central African interim leader said      Kony's LRA, which claimed to be fighting for the Ten Commandments when it was founded a quarter century ago, is considered one of the most brutal groups in Africa's recent history      It started as an insurgency fighting President Yoweri Museveni's regime but in recent years, its defeated remnants have operated mostly in neighbouring countries as a roving mercenary and extortionist gang      LRA men have raped and massacred villagers in the region, evading arrest in one of the most impenetrable regions of Africa straddling the borders of the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan      Envoys from the United Nations and the African Union said on Wednesday after meeting Djotodia there were indications that Kony might be seeking to come out of the bush because he is thought to be seriously ill      The LRA -- described by the International Crisis Group as a multinational criminal and terror band -- is thought to be a dwindling force of 500 fighters at most      There are 7,000 people with him, Djotodia said Thursday, presumably referring to enslaved abducted villagers He did not provide further information on Kony's whereabouts      'No reason to believe'      While Djotodia is believed to have had contact with some LRA fighters, we've no reason to believe that Joseph Kony is part of these negotiations, a senior US official told AFP      The group of fighters is thought to have said it would lay down arms if given some form of amnesty and land to farm in the Central African Republic, the official said      The group has claimed it could draw out other LRA fighters but we have no reason to believe that Joseph Kony himself is involved, at least at this time, the official added      The LRA has a loose structure, other gangs have used the name to sow terror in the region and a number of men have claimed to have a line to its elusive boss over the years, making any talks very complicated      UN envoy Abu Mussa and his AU counterpart Francisco Madeira said Wednesday they warned Djotodia against being tricked by Kony, who has walked out on several peace negotiations in the past      Djotodia, whose country has been sliding into chaos since he seized power in a March coup, is himself under increasing pressure from the international community, including the United States      He has failed to rein in his former Seleka rebel comrades and the UN has said it might have to send in thousands of peacekeepers amid growing concern a possible genocide was in the making      A former altar boy      A 3,000-strong Ugandan-led African force is currently hunting Kony      They are backed by about 100 military advisors from the United States, which has offered a $5 million reward for Kony's capture      Moussa said the Central African Republic authorities had expected a mass surrender by LRA fighters on November 3, but it did not happen      The 50-year-old Kony, a former altar boy who followed in the footsteps of messianic former prostitute and rebel leader Alice Lakwena in the late 1980s, is wanted by the International Criminal Court      In 2005, he was charged with 12 counts of crimes against humanity and 21 counts of war crimes, including murder, rape, forced enlistment of children and sexual enslavement      The list of crimes has grown longer since and according to a recent UN report, the LRA is responsible for 100,000 deaths over the past 25 years      It is also estimated to have abducted up to 100,000 children and caused the displacement of 2.5 million people over the same period      Kony surged to unexpected worldwide prominence in March 2012 on the back of a hugely popular

He released Lions in February this year, has already collaborated with Katy Perry and plans to release an EP this summer Before the ad premiered, Marley talked to HarpersBAZAAR.com about writing the song and being inspired by his grandfather's legacy      He's glad Pepsi chose his song for this commercial      It's such a good way of spreading a message, a gathering of unity So the music really goes hand in hand with the message of unity in this commercial I was happy that I could be a part of the new movement I was excited      Advertisement - Continue Reading Below      His message in Lions is about coming together      The 'Lions' inspiration was unity I started with a riff on the guitar, and I was playing the riff in the studio I knew the drums and then the song really fell in hand in hand We knew it had a power, a message, so it was really natural      He believes that uplifting message is all the more necessary at this political moment      We've always needed it, but right now we need it more than ever Well, it's a constant need of unity and togetherness So I just added onto that I'm happy that this generation grabbed onto it      The ad focuses on a lot of young people participating in a protest and making their voices heard, which is something Marley relates to      Young people are the future of the world It's a new generation, a new start We can do it better We're growing; as people, we're supposed to grow, we're supposed to learn, and the next generation grows and learns, you know?

{"article_number": 3006, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "If you’re in Italy, mark your calendar for Sept 22, when the country will celebrate its state-sponsored “Fertility Day” to promote family planning and parenthood Think that name is bad? It gets worse      The government’s campaign aimed at upping Italy’s birth rate, which health minister Beatrice Lorenzin introduced this week, features a series of 12 promotional images that were supposed to be encouraging but came off as oddly threatening and, alas, went viral for all the wrong reasons One with an image of a woman holding an hourglass says: “Beauty has no age But fertility does,” according to Quartz Another reads, “Male fertility is much more vulnerable than you might think,” and shows a browning banana peel      Italy’s low birth rate—along with its aging population and generous social services—is a threat to its financial future According to World Bank data, there were 1.4 childbirths per Italian woman in 2014, well below the world average of 2.45 For comparison, the U.K.’s rate was 1.8 and the United States’ was 1.9      Reuters reports that Italy’s birthrate landed at 1.35 last year, giving the country its lowest birth total in 154 years      The trouble with the Fertility Day campaign isn’t that the low birthrate won’t cause real problems, it’s that those problems shouldn’t be women’s to solve That’s especially true since Italian workplace culture is still stacked against women, as evidenced by a practice known as “dimissioni in bianco,” which a 2014 report by the European Parliament defined as “employers making [the] hiring of young women conditional to signing an undated letter of resignation to be used to justify dismissal in case of pregnancy.”      Subscribe to The World’s Most Powerful Women, Fortune’s daily must-read for global businesswomen      Another stark example pregnancy prejudice came in the recent race for Rome mayor When Giorgia Meloni announced her bid for the office while pregnant, she garnered unsolicited advice from former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who told a radio station, “A mother cannot be mayor Being mayor means being in your office 14 hours a day I don’t think this could be the right choice for Meloni.” (Berlusconi was ousted from office in 2011 after a string of sex and financial scandals.)      Critics of the Fertility Day campaign have also cited the nation’s high joblessness as a reason for the low birthrate and as the real issue—rather than women’s reproductive decisions—that the government should address In July, unemployment in the country was 11.4%—fourth-highest in the 28-member European Union      The opposition 5-Star Movement said in a statement that women “responsibly consider the future” before having kids “There’s no work [in Italy] People aren’t having kids because it’s not possible.”      Even Prime Minister Matteo Renzi criticized the campaign, telling a radio station Thursday, “I don’t know of any of my friends who had kids after they saw an advertisement.”      “If you want to create a society that invests in its future and has children, you have to make sure the underlying conditions are there,” he said, citing the need for good jobs and childcare services      The tone deafness of the campaign also reflects Italy’s on-going struggle to get more women in positions of power Women made some gains in June when 5 Star’s Virginia Raggi became the first female mayor of Rome, and Chiara Appendino, also of the Five Star Movement, clinched Turin’s mayorship But still, just 28% of Italy’s Senators and 31% of its House members are women There are five women in Renzi’s 16-member cabinet—down from eight in 2014      Italian media reports on Thursday indicated that Lorenzin was open to restructuring the campaign amid the on-going backlash The Ministry of Health told Fortune that Lorenzin stood by the “principal themes” of the campaign but is going to “improve the communicative approach.”      The campaign should be scrapped altogether since it implies that women are nothing more than baby-making machines—and it doesn’t help that it’s reminding people of the childrearing approach of dictator Benito Mussolini      This story has been updated to include the Ministry of Health’s comments ", "summary": "– \"Racism is in the eye of the beholder,\" according to Italy's Health Ministry—and an awful lot of people are beholding just that in ads the ministry sent out to promote a national push for procreation NBC News reports on the country's much-ballyhooed Fertility Day, an event taking place Thursday that the government hopes will boost the country's flagging birthrate, said to be the lowest in the EU The ads around the hot-and-heavy holiday are not only attracting claims of racism, but of sexism, too, with Fortune earlier this month calling the campaign \"a sexist mess,\" while Quartz labeled it \"an embarrassing misstep.\" The campaign kicked off in August, featuring a series of promos that some say are nothing more than fertility fear-mongering One of the ads shows a woman holding an hourglass with the caption \"Beauty has no age Critics say a) the low birthrate isn't women's problem, and b) the country isn't addressing unemployment, the real reason many people are choosing not to have kids (If you do want to have a baby, though: Chill.)", "summary_all": "– \"Racism is in the eye of the beholder,\" according to Italy's Health Ministry—and an awful lot of people are beholding just that in ads the ministry sent out to promote a national push for procreation NBC News reports on the country's much-ballyhooed Fertility Day, an event taking place Thursday that the government hopes will boost the country's flagging birthrate, said to be the lowest in the EU Events planned in cities around Italy (including Rome) on Fertility Day will include state-sponsored events where locals will be bombarded with baby-friendly propaganda about family planning, specifically about expanding families, per Quartz The ads around the hot-and-heavy holiday are not only attracting claims of racism, but of sexism, too, with Fortune earlier this month calling the campaign \"a sexist mess,\" while Quartz labeled it \"an embarrassing misstep.\" The campaign kicked off in August, featuring a series of promos that some say are nothing more than fertility fear-mongering One of the ads shows a woman holding an hourglass with the caption \"Beauty has no age Fertility does.\" And a pamphlet shows two cheerful white couples with the caption \"Good habits to promote,\" while the caption \"Bad company to leave behind\" is accompanied by a photo of a black woman apparently smoking pot, while a white woman hangs out with a black man who's drinking Critics say a) the low birthrate isn't women's problem, and b) the country isn't addressing unemployment, the real reason many people are choosing not to have kids Even Italy's prime minister is shaking his head \"I don't know of any of my friends who had kids after they saw an [ad],\" Matteo Renzi said in an early September radio interview, per Reuters (If you do want to have a baby, though: Chill.)"}
{"article_number": 3006, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " In its battle to get Italians to make more babies, the Italian government has made an embarrassing misstep      Health minister Beatrice Lorenzin recently announced that Sept 22 would be the country’s first ”Fertility Day,” when state-sponsored events in Rome, Bologna, Catania and Padova offer the public information about family planning and encourage parenthood In anticipation of that special day, the ministry launched a #FertilityDay campaign, with 12 promotional images that quickly went viral in all the wrong ways      Several images have a vaguely threatening tone: “Beauty has no age But fertility does,” reads one, with an image of a stress-smiling woman thrusting an hourglass into the foreground ”Fertility is a common good,” declares one ”Male fertility is much more vulnerable than you might think,” reads a third, with a picture of a decaying banana peel      Another image reads, “Young parents The best way to be creative.” But as many on Twitter have pointed out, Italy’s youth unemployment rate last year was a staggering 42%—which hardly makes creating dependents seem like the best way to be creative      The #FertilityDay campaign includes an online game, which Vice Italia compared to Space Invaders, and a website, from which most content has since been removed      (The tweet above reads: The site has been closed Its content was sterile.)      Author Roberto Saviano described the campaign as “an insult to all: Those who are not able to conceive, and to those who would like to, but do not have jobs.” Others responded to the campaign with humor:      According to the Health Ministry website, #FertilityDay is intended to remind Italians of the danger of falling birthrates, the “beauty” of parenthood, and eventual illnesses that could prevent parenthood The campaign also seeks to raise awareness of medications available for parents who have not been able to conceive It’s just one part of Italy’s national plan for fertility (Italian), which also includes financial incentives for parenthood      Low birthrates have long concerned governments across Europe As Quartz reported earlier this year:      The average fertility rate in the EU was 2.4 children per woman in 1970, but dropped to 1.5 in 2013, according to the OECD The OECD says a rate of 2.1 is required to ensure a stable population, so rates below this are bad for countries with aging populations, generous social services, and sclerotic economies (In other words, for Italy.)      But for women, a state’s emphasis on maternity can rub the wrong way Italy has long offered a generous paid maternity leave, but Italian women who work still battle entrenched prejudices that can make motherhood financially precarious In a phenomenon known as dimissioni in bianco, hundreds of thousands of Italian women have been asked to sign undated letters of resignation, so that employers can fire them without penalty, in case of pregnancy At the same time, access to abortion is legally guaranteed, but the procedure can be complicated to obtain in practice      https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CrL9rvVXgAAgNjc.jpg      As blogger Giulia Biasi writes on Medium:      What this campaign hides is the complete inability of the government to tackle the declining birth rate and subsequent decrease of cash flow towards the country’s already severely depleted public welfare If women choose not to have children — for personal or financial reasons, or both — who is going to pay the insane amount of taxes required to keep the system working? Not the children of immigrants, who are not awarded automatic citizenship even if born and raised on Italian soil It falls to Italian women to repopulate Italy, fulfilling their biological destiny and doing their patriotic duty      In other words, plenty of Italian women already know that low birthrates are a problem for the current system They just don’t think it’s their problem to solve ", "summary": "Events planned in cities around Italy (including Rome) on Fertility Day will include state-sponsored events where locals will be bombarded with baby-friendly propaganda about family planning, specifically about expanding families, per Quartz", "summary_all": "– \"Racism is in the eye of the beholder,\" according to Italy's Health Ministry—and an awful lot of people are beholding just that in ads the ministry sent out to promote a national push for procreation NBC News reports on the country's much-ballyhooed Fertility Day, an event taking place Thursday that the government hopes will boost the country's flagging birthrate, said to be the lowest in the EU Events planned in cities around Italy (including Rome) on Fertility Day will include state-sponsored events where locals will be bombarded with baby-friendly propaganda about family planning, specifically about expanding families, per Quartz The ads around the hot-and-heavy holiday are not only attracting claims of racism, but of sexism, too, with Fortune earlier this month calling the campaign \"a sexist mess,\" while Quartz labeled it \"an embarrassing misstep.\" The campaign kicked off in August, featuring a series of promos that some say are nothing more than fertility fear-mongering One of the ads shows a woman holding an hourglass with the caption \"Beauty has no age Fertility does.\" And a pamphlet shows two cheerful white couples with the caption \"Good habits to promote,\" while the caption \"Bad company to leave behind\" is accompanied by a photo of a black woman apparently smoking pot, while a white woman hangs out with a black man who's drinking Critics say a) the low birthrate isn't women's problem, and b) the country isn't addressing unemployment, the real reason many people are choosing not to have kids Even Italy's prime minister is shaking his head \"I don't know of any of my friends who had kids after they saw an [ad],\" Matteo Renzi said in an early September radio interview, per Reuters (If you do want to have a baby, though: Chill.)"}

Show Hide Of all the issues at the heart of the enduring conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, none is as sensitive as the status of Jerusalem The holy city has been at the centre of peace-making efforts for decades Seventy years ago, when the UN voted to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, Jerusalem was defined as a separate entity under international supervision In the war of 1948 it was divided, like Berlin in the cold war, into western and eastern sectors under Israeli and Jordanian control respectively Nineteen years later, in June 1967, Israel captured the eastern side, expanded the city’s boundaries and annexed it – an act that was never recognised internationally Israel routinely describes the city, with its Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy places, as its “united and eternal” capital For their part, the Palestinians say East Jerusalem must be the capital of a future independent Palestinian state The unequivocal international view, accepted by all previous US administrations, is that the city’s status must be addressed in peace negotiations Recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital puts the US out of step with the rest of the world, and legitimises Israeli settlement-building in the east – considered illegal under international law Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP      In his own speech Israel’s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, said UN members who backed the resolution were being manipulated “You are like puppets pulled by your Palestinian masters,” he told the session      While Thursday’s resolution was in support of existing UN resolutions on Jerusalem and the peace process, the clumsy intervention by Trump and Haley also made the vote a referendum on Trump’s often unilateral and abrasive foreign policy      The debate and vote highlighted for a second time in a week the international isolation of the United States over the Jerusalem issue, following a similar vote in the security council on Tuesday in which it was outnumbered 14-1            Trump's bullying and bluster on Jerusalem is bad news for the UN | Patrick Wintour Read more      The threatening US posture, which had been denounced as both counter-productive and “bullying”, only seemed to have hardened the resolve of countries in opposing Trump’s 6 December move      The resolution, co-sponsored by Turkey and Yemen, called Trump’s recognition “null and void” and reaffirmed 10 security council resolutions on Jerusalem, dating back to 1967, including requirements that the city’s final status must be decided in direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians      It also “demands that all states comply with security council resolutions regarding the holy city of Jerusalem, and not to recognise any actions or measures contrary to those resolutions”      Earlier on Thursday, as it had become clear that the US and Israel would be heavily defeated, Netanyahu preemptively denounced the vote calling the UN a “house of lies”      “The state of Israel rejects this vote outright,” Netanyahu said “Jerusalem is our capital, we will continue to build there and additional embassies will move to Jerusalem      “Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, whether or not the UN recognises this It took 70 years for the United States to formally recognise this, and it will take years for the UN to do the same.”      Michael Oren, Israel’s deputy minister for diplomacy, called for Israel to cut its ties with the UN and expel the organisation from its Jerusalem offices      “We must evict the UN from the scenic Governor’s House, where its bloated staff does nothing, and give this historic site to a school, a hospital or – best yet – a new US embassy.” ", "summary": "6 declaration", "summary_all": "– \"The US will be taking names,\" Nikki Haley warned Wednesday ahead of the UN General Assembly's Thursday vote on whether to reject President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel It has a lot of names to take: The vote was 128-9 in favor of the nonbinding resolution that demands the US walk back its Dec 6 declaration The vote \"amount[s] to a collective act of defiance toward Washington,\" the New York Times reports The AP reports Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reacted by tweeting, \"We expect the Trump administration to rescind without further delay its unfortunate decision, whose illegality has been clearly established.\" How the vote went: There were 35 abstentions and 21 no-shows; one of the abstentions was Canada, which the Guardian reports had been thought to be a vote on the US side Voting along with the US and Israel were Togo, Micronesia, Guatemala, Nauru, Palau, Marshall Islands, and Honduras, reports the Times of Israel The Jerusalem Post sees the final tally as demonstrating Israel \"has made inroads in Latin America\"; it points out both Argentina and Mexico abstained."}

{"article_number": 1136, "article_idx": 2, "article_text": " American threats to cut off aid to countries voting in favor of a General Assembly resolution condemning the US for deciding to move its embassy to Jerusalem did not move the needle too far inside the world body, as the measure passed handily on Thursday by a vote of 128 against nine, with 35 abstentions and 21 countries not voting            The vote – a symbolic act unlikely to change any facts on the ground or politics in foreign capitals – was elevated in importance after US President Donald Trump said he would take the tally personally, and that the votes of states would be remembered as Washington considers further aid to the international body                  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu quickly responded to the vote, saying that “Israel completely rejects this preposterous resolution.”“Jerusalem is our capital, always was, always will be,” he said “But I do appreciate the fact that a growing number of countries refuse to participate in this theater of the absurd.”He said he wanted to especially thank Trump and ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley for “their stalwart defense of Israel, and their stalwart defense of the truth.”The Palestinians, on the other hand, applauded the results Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’ spokesman Nabil Abu Rudaineh said the vote is a “victory for Palestine.”“We will continue our efforts in the United Nations and at all international forums to put an end to this occupation and to establish our Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital,” he said.The results of this vote were not significantly different than results of two other special votes in the General Assembly regarding the conflict over the last five years.In 2012, the Palestinians gained non-member observer status as a state by a vote of 138 to nine, with 41 abstentions and five no-shows And a 2015 measure giving them the right to fly their flag at the UN passed 119 to eight, with 45 abstentions, and 21 countries not participating.Before Thursday’s vote, US ambassador Nikki Haley told the world body that its hostility toward Israel is “wrong [and] undermines the credibility of this institution, and that in turn is harmful for the entire world.”Haley said that Israel remains in the UN, despite the organization’s hostility, because “it’s important to stand up for yourself Israel must stand up for its own survival as a nation, but it also stands up for the ideals of freedom and human dignity that the United Nations is supposed to be about.”Reiterating threats to remember who voted against the US, Haley said her country “will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation We will remember it when we are called upon to once again make the world’s largest contribution to the United Nations And we will remember it when so many countries come calling on us, as they so often do, to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit.”America, she declared, “will put [its] embassy in Jerusalem That is what the American people want us to do, and it is the right thing to do No vote in the United Nations will make any difference on that But this vote will make a difference on how Americans look at the UN and on how we look at countries who disrespect us in the UN And this vote will be remembered.”Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of the world’s body adopted the resolution declaring – without mentioning the US by name – the decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital as “null and void and [that it] must be rescinded.”Twenty-two of the 28 EU countries voted for the resolution, including Germany, which in the past has abstained on measures attacking Israel Greece and Cyprus, with whom Israel has an alliance in the eastern Mediterranean and which abstained in the 2015 vote on the Palestinian flag issue, also voted for the measure.Five EU countries, however, broke with the EU consensus and abstained: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland and Romania Lithuania did not show up for the vote.The vote showed that Israel has made inroads in Latin America, as Argentina, Mexico and Colombia – all countries that Netanyahu visited in September – abstained.Notably, India, with whom Israel has forged very strong ties and where Netanyahu will be traveling next month, voted for the measure.In addition to the US and Israel, the other countries that voted against the measure were Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo.Israel’s ambassador Danny Danon said before the vote: “Those who support today’s resolution are like puppets You are puppets pulled by the strings of your Palestinian puppet masters You are like marionettes forced to dance while the Palestinian leadership looks on with glee You are blind to the lies Unaware of the manipulation surrounding you – just like a puppet.”This vote, he said, “is nothing more than a performance of delusion.”Holding up a coin from around the year 67 with the Hebrew inscription “Freedom of Zion,” he said that this “proves the ancient connection of Jews to Jerusalem.”Danon continued, “Our bond to Jerusalem is unbreakable No UNESCO declaration, no empty speeches, no General Assembly resolution will ever drive us from Jerusalem.”Though comments made over the last two days by Trump and Haley saying that the US would take note of how each country votes – as well as vigorous Israeli diplomatic efforts – did little to alter the outcome that was foreseen from the start, it did impact the number of countries asking to make a statement before the vote.Part of Israel’s efforts over the last two days was to keep western, Democratic countries from making such statements, and in that Jerusalem was successful In addition to the Palestinian Authority, the other countries which spoke and slammed Israel with varying degrees of vitriol were Yemen, Turkey, Venezuela, Pakistan, Indonesia, the Maldives, Syria, Bangladesh, Cuba, Iran, China, Malaysia and North Korea.The representative of the Vatican also spoke, and essentially called for the internationalization of Jerusalem.“The Holy See calls for peaceful resolution that respects the nature of Jerusalem, its sacredness and universal value, and reiterates that only an international guaranteed status can preserve its unique character and be an assurance for dialogue and reconciliation for peace in the region.”Even before the vote, Netanyahu called the UN a “House of Lies,” and predicted that eventually all the embassies will move to Jerusalem because “truth will win out.”      Join Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade

{"article_number": 1136, "article_idx": 3, "article_text": " The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday defied warnings from the United States and overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning the Trump administration’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and calling on countries not to move their diplomatic missions to the city      A total of 128 countries voted in favor of the text, defying President Donald Trump’s threat — forcefully reiterated in an address before the vote by US envoy Nikki Haley — to cut aid to countries that opposed the motion      Nine countries — the US, Israel, Togo, Micronesia, Guatemala, Nauru, Palau, Marshall Islands and Honduras — voted against the resolution      Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up      There were 35 abstentions, including a number of countries that had been widely expected to support the move, such as Colombia, Mexico, Malawi and Rwanda A further 21 countries did not vote at all      By abstaining, Hungary, Croatia, Latvia, Romania and the Czech Republic broke European Union consensus on the vote The EU had previously vehemently rejected any attempt to change Jerusalem’s status in the absence of a final peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians      Haley tweeted after the vote that “65 countries refused to condemn the United States” — totaling the no votes, the abstentions and the no-shows      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, in a video, that “Israel completely rejects this preposterous resolution Jerusalem is our capital — always was, always will be.” However, he added, “I do appreciate the fact that a growing number of countries refuse to participate in this theater of the absurd.” He thanked Trump and Haley for their “stalwart defense” of Israel and the truth      Posted by The Prime Minister of Israel on Thursday, 21 December 2017      Israel’s Foreign Ministry said the number of countries that either opposed, abstained or were absent from the vote was “hugely significant.” The vote shows that “not the whole world is part of this show,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Emmanuel Nachshon said      A spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said “The vote is a victory for Palestine,” and promised that the Palestinians would “continue our efforts in the United Nations and at all international forums to put an end to this occupation and to establish our Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital.”      On Monday, in the Security Council, 14 out of 15 members voted in favor of the resolution, which failed to pass due to an American veto There are no vetoes at the General Assembly, but — as opposed to the Security Council — resolutions passed there are not legally binding      In November 2012, 138 countries voted on favor of a General Assembly resolution giving nonmember state status to the “State of Palestine.” Nine countries opposed the motion, with 41 abstentions Less than a month ago, 151 countries voted in favor of a General Assembly resolution that condemns Israel in much harsher terms than Thursday’s vote Only six countries opposed the motion, while nine abstained      Recalling previous General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, the text passed Thursday expressed “deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem,” referring to Trump’s December 6 decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and his announced intention to move the US embassy to the city      The resolution also affirmed that “any decisions and actions which purport to have altered, the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council, and in this regard, calls upon all States to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the Holy City of Jerusalem.”      Without naming any country, it expressed “deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem.”      Before the vote, a series of officials addressed the “emergency special session” on “[i]llegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.” The session was called by Yemen and Turkey      The US ambassador to the UN, Haley, defended the administration’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, said the US had the sovereign right to place its embassies where it wished, and warned that America — the biggest funder of the UN — did not take kindly to being disrespected and paying for the “dubious privilege.”      “The decision does not prejudge any final status issues, including Jerusalem’s boundaries The decision does not preclude a two-state solution, if the parties agree to that,” she said “The decision does nothing to harm peace efforts Rather, the president’s decision reflects the will of the American people and our right as a nation to choose the location of our embassy.”      “America will put our embassy to Jerusalem,” Haley stressed “That’s what the American people want us to do And it’s the right thing to do.” No vote at the UN will make any difference on the American decision, she declared But this vote will be remembered, she vowed, when America is being asked once again to make the single-largest contribution to the UN budget or when “so many countries come calling on us, as they so often do, to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit.”      “Those who support today’s resolution are like puppets pulled by the strings of the Palestinian puppet masters,” Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said “You are like marionettes forced to dance while the Palestinian leadership looks on with glee.”      Passing the resolution distances the prospects for peace, Danon added “If you vote for it, you’re rejecting peace,” he said, adding that he had no doubt that this resolution will end up “in the trash bin of history.”      During his speech, Danon displayed a coin from 67 AD minted during the Jewish revolt against the Romans, replicas of which had been distributed to the UN ambassadors before the vote “On this coin is written ‘Freedom of Zion.’ It proves the ancient connection of Jews to Jerusalem,” Danon said “No UNESCO declaration, no empty speeches, no General Assembly resolution will ever drive us from Jerusalem.”      Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki attacked the US recognition of Jerusalem as an act of “aggression.” Palestine accepts the US’s right to make sovereign decisions, but only as long they are in line with international law, he said      Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu called Trump’s Jerusalem recognition a violation of international law and an “attack on all universal values.”      He said that a member state had threatened all the other members to vote no or “face the consequences,” likely referring to the US Countries were threatened with development aid cut, he went on “This is bullying and this chamber will not do that It is unethical to think the votes and dignity are for sale … We will not be intimidated You may be strong, but that does not make you right.”      Israeli officials had rejected the vote’s outcome before it took place      “The State of Israel flatly rejects this vote even before it is held,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier on Thursday “Jerusalem is our capital We will continue to build in it and foreign embassies, led by the US embassy, will move to Jerusalem It will happen.”      In the run-up to Thursday’s vote, Israeli diplomats stationed abroad made strenuous efforts to get as many countries as possible to oppose or abstain on the resolution      “The Foreign Ministry is continuing its efforts to persuade as many countries as possible not to support the resolution, including by avoiding the vote,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Emmanuel Nahshon said hours before the vote      “It is an effort stretching across the globe, in every continent,” he said “Special effort is being made in Europe, in the hope of preventing a European consensus supporting the resolution.”      On Wednesday, Trump had praised Haley for warning foreign diplomats that she will be “taking names” of countries that support the resolution criticizing America’s position on Jerusalem      “I like the message that Nikki sent yesterday at the United Nations for all of these nations that take our money and then they vote against us at the Security Council, or they vote against us potentially at the assembly,” the president told members of his cabinet in the White House      “They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us,” he said “Well, we’re watching those votes Let them vote against us, we’ll save a lot We don’t care.” ", "summary": "Voting along

{"article_number": 1215, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "This afternoon, CNN reported that President Barack Obama and President-Elect Donald Trump had been briefed by the intelligence community on the existence of a cache of memos alleging communication between the Trump campaign and Russian officials and the possession by the Russian government of highly compromising material against Trump The memos were compiled by a former British intelligence officer on behalf of anti-Trump Republicans and, later, Democrats working against Trump in the general election According to CNN, the intelligence officer’s previous work is credible, but the veracity of the specific allegations set forth in the document have not yet been confirmed Notably, Mother Jones journalist David Corn reported the week before the election on similar allegations that Trump had been “cultivated” by Russian intelligence, on the basis of a memos produced by “a former senior intelligence officer for a Western country.” A similar report also appeared in Newsweek      This cache of memos has been kicking around official Washington for several weeks now A great many journalists have been feverishly working to document the allegations within it, which are both explosive and quite various: some of them relate to alleged collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russian intelligence, while others relate to personal sexual conduct by Trump himself that supposedly constitutes a rip-roaring KOMPROMAT file      If you are finding Lawfare useful in these times, please consider making a contribution to support what we do      We have had the document for a couple of weeks and have chosen, as have lots of other publications, not to publish it while the allegations within it remain unproven In response to CNN’s report, however, Buzzfeed has now released the underlying document itself, which is available here      Whether or not its release is defensible in light of the CNN story, it is now important to emphasize several points      First, we have no idea if any of these allegations are true Yes, they are explosive; they are also entirely unsubstantiated, at least to our knowledge, at this stage For this reason, even now, we are not going to discuss the specific allegations within the document      Second, while unproven, the allegations are being taken quite seriously The President and President-elect do not get briefed on material that the intelligence community does not believe to be at least of some credibility The individual who generated them is apparently a person whose work intelligence professionals take seriously And at a personal level, we can attest that we have had a lot of conversations with a lot of different people about the material in this document While nobody has confirmed any of the allegations, both inside government and in the press, it is clear to us that they are the subject of serious attention      Third, precisely because it is being taken seriously, it is—despite being unproven and, in public anyway, undiscussed—pervasively affecting the broader discussion of Russian hacking of the election CNN reported that Senator John McCain personally delivered a copy of the document to FBI Director James Comey on December 9th Consider McCain’s comments about the gravity of the Russian hacking episode at last week’s Armed Services Committee hearing in light of that fact Likewise, consider Senator Ron Wyden’s questioning of Comey at today’s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, in which Wyden pushed the FBI Director to release a declassified assessment before January 20th regarding contact between the Trump campaign and the Russian government (Comey refused to comment on an ongoing investigation.)      So while people are being delicate about discussing wholly unproven allegations, the document is at the front of everyone’s minds as they ponder the question: Why is Trump so insistent about vindicating Russia from the hacking charges that everyone else seems to accept?      Fourth, it is significant that the document contains highly specific allegations, many of which are the kind of facts it should be possible to prove or disprove This is a document about meetings that either took place or did not take place, stays in hotels that either happened or didn’t, travel that either happened or did not happen It should be possible to know whether at least some of these allegations are true or false      Finally, fifth, it is important to emphasize that this is not a case of the intelligence community leaking sensitive information about an investigative subject out of revenge or any other improper motive This type of information, referencing sensitive sources and methods and the identities of U.S persons, is typically treated by the intelligence community with the utmost care And this material, in fact, does not come from the intelligence community; it comes, rather, from private intelligence documents put together by a company It is actually not even classified      All of which is to say to everyone: slow down, and take a deep breath We shouldn’t assume either that this is simply a “fake news” episode directed at discrediting Trump or that the dam has now broken and the truth is coming out at last We don’t know what the reality is here, and the better part of valor is not to get ahead ahead of the facts—a matter on which, incidentally, the press deserves a lot of credit      UPDATE: The Guardian reports:      The Guardian has learned that the FBI applied for a warrant from the foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court over the summer in order to monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials The Fisa court turned down the application asking FBI counter-intelligence investigators to narrow its focus According to one report, the FBI was finally granted a warrant in October, but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation      UPDATE II: Trump just tweeted this:      FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT! — Donald J Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2017      Mic reports that Michael Cohen, Trump's special counsel, has denied several allegations contained within the report, some pertaining to Cohen specifically ", "summary": "At the Atlantic, David A \"It is to gather information, sift through it, and determine what is true and what is not.\" Here, for instance, is New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet's explanation of its own decision: \"We, like others, investigated the allegations and haven't corroborated them, and we felt we're not in the business of publishing things we can’t stand by.\" As for that corroboration, Lawfare makes this point: \"This is a document about meetings that either took place or did not take place, stays in hotels that either happened or didn’t, travel that either happened or did not happen It should be possible to know whether at least some of these allegations are true or false.\" ProPublica President Richard Tofel suggests the publication an hour prior to BuzzFeed's dump of a CNN story that reported Trump and President Obama had received a two-page summary of the reports last week, changes the game", "summary_all": "– \"The documents have circulated for months and acquired a kind of legendary status among journalists, lawmakers, and intelligence officials who have seen them.\" So writes BuzzFeed in introducing the 35-page dossier it published Tuesday night that alleges Russia has compromising information, both financial and personal, on President-elect Donald Trump Their publication raises some big questions about journalistic ethics: Why did BuzzFeed decide to pull the trigger on publishing in full (in its words) \"unverified, and potentially unverifiable allegations\"?

Subscribe to our free newsletters                  On Friday, FBI Director James Comey set off a political blast when he informed congressional leaders that the bureau had stumbled across emails that might be pertinent to its completed inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s handling of emails when she was secretary of state The Clinton campaign and others criticized Comey for intervening in a presidential campaign by breaking with Justice Department tradition and revealing information about an investigation—information that was vague and perhaps ultimately irrelevant—so close to Election Day On Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid upped the ante He sent Comey a fiery letter saying the FBI chief may have broken the law and pointed to a potentially greater controversy: “In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government…The public has a right to know this information.”      Reid’s missive set off a burst of speculation on Twitter and elsewhere What was he referring to regarding the Republican presidential nominee? At the end of August, Reid had written to Comey and demanded an investigation of the “connections between the Russian government and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign,” and in that letter he indirectly referred to Carter Page, an American businessman cited by Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers, who had financial ties to Russia and had recently visited Moscow Last month, Yahoo News reported that US intelligence officials were probing the links between Page and senior Russian officials (Page has called accusations against him “garbage.”) On Monday, NBC News reported that the FBI has mounted a preliminary inquiry into the foreign business ties of Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chief But Reid’s recent note hinted at more than the Page or Manafort affairs And a former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence tells Mother Jones that in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump—and that the FBI requested more information from him      “This is something of huge significance, way above party politics,” the former intelligence officer says “I think [Trump’s] own party should be aware of this stuff as well.”      Does this mean the FBI is investigating whether Russian intelligence has attempted to develop a secret relationship with Trump or cultivate him as an asset? Was the former intelligence officer and his material deemed credible or not? An FBI spokeswoman says, “Normally, we don’t talk about whether we are investigating anything.” But a senior US government official not involved in this case but familiar with the former spy tells Mother Jones that he has been a credible source with a proven record of providing reliable, sensitive, and important information to the US government      In June, the former Western intelligence officer—who spent almost two decades on Russian intelligence matters and who now works with a US firm that gathers information on Russia for corporate clients—was assigned the task of researching Trump’s dealings in Russia and elsewhere, according to the former spy and his associates in this American firm This was for an opposition research project originally financed by a Republican client critical of the celebrity mogul (Before the former spy was retained, the project’s financing switched to a client allied with Democrats.) “It started off as a fairly general inquiry,” says the former spook, who asks not to be identified But when he dug into Trump, he notes, he came across troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government According to his sources, he says, “there was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.”      This was, the former spy remarks, “an extraordinary situation.” He regularly consults with US government agencies on Russian matters, and near the start of July on his own initiative—without the permission of the US company that hired him—he sent a report he had written for that firm to a contact at the FBI, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates, who asked not to be identified (He declines to identify the FBI contact.) The former spy says he concluded that the information he had collected on Trump was “sufficiently serious” to share with the FBI      Mother Jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer’s conversations with Russian sources, noted, “Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.” It maintained that Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.” It claimed that Russian intelligence had “compromised” Trump during his visits to Moscow and could “blackmail him.” It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on “bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.”      The former intelligence officer says the response from the FBI was “shock and horror.” The FBI, after receiving the first memo, did not immediately request additional material, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates Yet in August, they say, the FBI asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources The former spy forwarded to the bureau several memos—some of which referred to members of Trump’s inner circle After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI “It’s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,” he says      “This is something of huge significance, way above party politics,” the former intelligence officer comments “I think [Trump’s] own party should be aware of this stuff as well.”      The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment regarding the memos In the past, Trump has declared, “I have nothing to do with Russia.”      The FBI is certainly investigating the hacks attributed to Russia that have hit American political targets, including the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, the chairman of Clinton’s presidential campaign But there have been few public signs of whether that probe extends to examining possible contacts between the Russian government and Trump (In recent weeks, reporters in Washington have pursued anonymous online reports that a computer server related to the Trump Organization engaged in a high level of activity with servers connected to Alfa Bank, the largest private bank in Russia On Monday, a Slate investigation detailed the pattern of unusual server activity but concluded, “We don’t yet know what this [Trump] server was for, but it deserves further explanation.” In an email to Mother Jones, Hope Hicks, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, maintains, “The Trump Organization is not sending or receiving any communications from this email server The Trump Organization has no communication or relationship with this entity or any Russian entity.” )      According to several national security experts, there is widespread concern in the US intelligence community that Russian intelligence, via hacks, is aiming to undermine the presidential election—to embarrass the United States and delegitimize its democratic elections And the hacks appear to have been designed to benefit Trump In August, Democratic members of the House committee on oversight wrote Comey to ask the FBI to investigate “whether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests may have contributed to these [cyber] attacks in order to interfere with the US presidential election.” In September, Sen Dianne Feinstein and Rep Adam Schiff, the senior Democrats on, respectively, the Senate and House intelligence committees, issued a joint statement accusing Russia of underhanded meddling: “Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S election At the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election.” The Obama White House has declared Russia the culprit in the hacking capers, expressed outrage, and promised a “proportional” response      There’s no way to tell whether the FBI has confirmed or debunked any of the allegations contained in the former spy’s memos But a Russian intelligence attempt to co-opt or cultivate a presidential candidate would mark an even more serious operation than the hacking      In the letter Reid sent to Comey on Sunday, he pointed out that months ago he had asked the FBI director to release information on Trump’s possible Russia ties Since then, according to a Reid spokesman, Reid has been briefed several times The spokesman adds, “He is confident that he knows enough to be extremely alarmed.” ", "summary": "– \"The documents have circulated for months and acquired a kind of legendary status among journalists, lawmakers, and intelligence officials who have seen them.\" So writes

{"article_number": 1215, "article_idx": 4, "article_text": " Where does transparency meet irresponsibility? Right at the line that BuzzFeed’s editor Ben Smith approached Tuesday and decided to step over in the name of serving citizens’ best interests      With caveats and explanations aplenty, Smith published a 35-page “dossier” — actually just a bunch of scurrilous allegations dressed up as an intelligence report meant to damage Donald Trump      Smith said he did so because his, and BuzzFeed’s, preference and philosophy is, essentially, “When in doubt, publish.” But at many other news organizations, the rule is caution: “When in doubt, leave it out.”      In this case, the doubt should have prevailed News organizations and government officials have known for months that this information, if it can be called that, existed But despite many attempts, the claims about Trump’s behavior and relationships in Russia could not be verified      Thus, major newspapers and magazines sat on them In October, the Washington bureau chief of Mother Jones, David Corn, wrote a story based on the file but stopped well short of publishing the specifics      (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)      Why? Because he couldn’t verify them      So what changed and blew this out into the public eye? Not just BuzzFeed’s data dump, but a series of events Intelligence agencies summarized the “dossier” and included it in material given to Trump and President Obama      CNN published a story Tuesday saying that much And with the door cracked open, BuzzFeed pushed through In doing so, the digital behemoth — which for years has balanced a tension between its start as a lighthearted click factory and, under Smith and a serious news team, a purveyor of investigative journalism and breaking news — set off a fierce debate      “Publishing this dossier reflects how we see the job of reporters in 2017,” Smith wrote In other words, readers are grown-ups and deserve to be treated as such, not paternalistically protected from information that might upset them True enough, but it avoids the larger point: It’s a bad idea, and always has been, to publish unverified smears      The decision certainly resulted in clicks It also brought approval and disapproval, in some cases from unexpected quarters      Richard Tofel, president of ProPublica, praised the decision: “Kudos to @buzzfeedben and his team for publishing the dossier Once CNN story out, citizens should have evidence to consider for themselves.”      Journalist Michael Tracey noted that while WikiLeaks had been “relentlessly attacked” for publishing verified, authentic information, BuzzFeed was being “cheered for publishing what appears to be a total sham.”      (The Washington Post)      And in the New York Post, columnist and longtime magazine editor John Podhoretz made a solid point: “In my experience, there is no source of whom you need to be more skeptical, and whose information you need to verify to the letter before you can even begin to think of publishing it, than an ‘intelligence’ source.”      Once BuzzFeed published, of course, the dam burst Slate followed, publishing the documents itself, and anyone in the world had access with a few keystrokes      Trump — who gave his first news conference Wednesday — immediately took to Twitter to brand the information “fake news” and to blame a political witch hunt The publication of the documents does, indeed, give fuel to the notion that the press is out to get him      Most mainstream outlets, including The Washington Post, even now are staying away from the specifics of the report, said to be prepared by a former British intelligence official Those media organizations don’t get much credit these days for skepticism and editorial judgment, but for the most part, they have shown it here      I don’t fault BuzzFeed for lack of skepticism here Smith was clear with readers that the information he was publishing couldn’t be verified and, indeed, there was no reason to believe that much of it was true What I fault him for was plunging down a slippery ethical slope from which there is no return      In an era when trust in the media is already in the gutter, this does absolutely nothing to help But even that isn’t the core point, which is far simpler:      It’s never been acceptable to publish rumor and innuendo And none of the circumstances surrounding this episode — not CNN’s story, not Trump’s dubious history with Russia, not the fact that the intelligence community made a report on it — should change that ethical rule      For more by Margaret Sullivan, visit wapo.st/sullivan ", "summary": "He tweeted BuzzFeed \"kudos ..

{"article_number": 1215, "article_idx": 5, "article_text": " Drew Angerer/Getty Images      BuzzFeed on Tuesday published a 35-page dossier comprising a series of memos, containing intelligence reportedly gathered by a former British intelligence agent as opposition research, about alleged ties between President-elect Donald Trump and Russia It included claims that Russian authorities have been “cultivating and supporting” Trump for “at least five years” and obtained compromising material on Trump that included video of “perverted” sex acts in a Moscow hotel      Will Oremus Will Oremus is Slate’s senior technology writer Email him at will.oremus@slate.com or follow him on Twitter      The dossier was not new BuzzFeed and multiple other news organizations had obtained it well before Tuesday and had been investigating its various claims Mother Jones wrote about it prior to the election, on Oct 31, and published a handful of quotes from it Key figures in Congress had also seen it and even publicly alluded to it, and the Guardian reported on Tuesday that Sen John McCain had passed it to FBI Director James Comey last month But no one had published its entire, stunning contents before Tuesday—partly because, as my colleague Joshua Keating put it, “nothing in the memos has been confirmed, and even their provenance is murky.”      Advertisement            BuzzFeed posted the dossier in full, prefacing it with a series of caveats about its veracity and updating it shortly afterward with a vehement denial from Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen, about whom the memo makes several claims Why did the site opt to publish what so many others had opted not to? And why now, in particular? The answers point to a media industry that still takes its “gatekeeping” functions more seriously than it sometimes gets credit for—even if it doesn’t always perform them      BuzzFeed’s editor, Ben Smith, explained the decision in a memo to his staff, which he subsequently provided to me and then published on Twitter:      Here's the note I sent to @buzzfeednews staff this evening pic.twitter.com/OcAloWzVzb — Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) January 11, 2017      Smith didn’t address why BuzzFeed waited until now to publish the document, and he declined to comment further for this article But the move came almost immediately after CNN reported Tuesday that top U.S intelligence officials had shown Trump and President Obama a two-page synopsis of the dossier The synopsis was presented as an unofficial appendage to the classified security briefings they gave Obama and Trump about Russian interference in the presidential election, CNN reported Sources also told CNN that the “Gang of Eight” Congressional leaders had been provided a synopsis of the dossier as well      That top U.S intelligence officials saw fit to brief Trump and Obama on the dossier would seem to indicate that they took the claims at least somewhat seriously, even though they’ve been unable to verify them and, as BuzzFeed noted, the memos contain some “clear errors.” But CNN’s report suggests that the briefing was partly just about making Trump aware that the dossier existed and was circulating at the highest levels of the U.S government      Advertisement            CNN declined to disclose the substance of the claims, writing, “At this point, CNN is not reporting on details of the memos, as it has not independently corroborated the specific allegations.” Smith and BuzzFeed saw it differently It’s possible that if they hadn’t published it Tuesday night, someone else would have      (Slate, for its part, followed BuzzFeed’s lead and published the dossier later Tuesday as part of Keating’s blog post about it Asked why Slate ran it, Editor in Chief Julia Turner told me, “The memos BuzzFeed published today are newsworthy documents, and BuzzFeed’s decision to publish was news too In covering BuzzFeed’s scoop and its implications, we described the allegations in the memos and the questions about their veracity; we thought it served our readers best to republish the documents as well so readers could evaluate the memos for themselves.”)      BuzzFeed was acting in a tradition in which the notion of media as privileged gatekeeper of information is viewed with disdain      What we have, with the memo, is a set of explosive charges against the president-elect that no one so far has been able to either verify or fully debunk What’s remarkable, in a time of social media, blogs, polarized politics, hacks, and leaks, is that the dossier stayed private for so long, even as the Clinton campaign and Democrats saw their private communications splashed across the news No doubt that was due at least in part to the claims’ sensational nature and the enormous impact they could have, if verified or even just widely believed      David Corn, the Mother Jones journalist who wrote the magazine's comparatively circumspect Oct 31 report on the allegations, tweeted Tuesday night that he did not publish the full memos at the time because he could not verify their allegations For Corn—and for journalist Julia Ioffe, who tweeted that she was “approached with this story” but turned it down because it was “impossible to verify”—that call came down to ethics and standard operating procedure Clearly the internet has not turned journalism into a shameless, traffic-thirsty free-for-all      1 For those asking, I didn't publish the full memos from the intelligence operative because I could not confirm the allegations — David Corn (@DavidCornDC) January 11, 2017      Advertisement            Yet the dossier did come out eventually, and it’s interesting to reflect on how and why it happened—and whether it was inevitable It happened via a series of steps by various actors, each of whom relied on the actions of those before them to justify their own decisions BuzzFeed presumably published it in part because CNN was reporting on it CNN was reporting on it because intelligence officials had briefed Trump on it Intelligence officials briefed Trump on it because senior congressional leaders were passing it around Senior congressional leaders may have been passing it around in part because Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid alluded to it in a letter blasting FBI Director James Comey for publicizing information harmful to Hillary Clinton but not publicizing the dirt on Trump Each act lowered the bar for those who followed to act on information that they knew might or might not be true      Whether BuzzFeed was right or wrong to publish the memo—and whether it should have presented it with more critical commentary or context—is a question that will be debated in future classes on journalism ethics For now I’ll just point out that, while Smith has at times proudly positioned BuzzFeed as a member of the “mainstream media,” he was acting here in a different tradition It was the tradition of internet media and blogs—one pioneered by Matt Drudge, who famously broke the Monica Lewinsky scandal by reporting that Newsweek was sitting on it, and by the now-defunct Gawker It’s a tradition in which the notion of media as privileged gatekeeper of information is viewed with disdain It’s one in which sensitive and embarrassing information about public figures is readily disclosed, ostensibly out of respect for the public’s intelligence and right to know It’s also one in which publishers are rewarded for publishing such bombshells, not with prestigious industry award, but with notoriety, page views, and social media shares      Smith’s defense of his decision evinces an understanding of this tradition and BuzzFeed’s place in it “We have always erred on the side of publishing,” he writes There is virtue in this posture among journalists, insofar as it serves as a societal counterweight to the tendency of people in positions of power to suppress information that could embarrass them The question is just how far you’re willing to err in that direction, and Smith acknowledges that this was a particularly close call It rings just a tad disingenuous, however, when BuzzFeed claims to have published the documents simply “so that Americans can make up their own minds” about the allegations If America’s top intelligence agencies, congressional staffs, and investigative journalists—including BuzzFeed’s own decorated investigative team—couldn’t make up their minds about the allegations, how do they expect the average reader to do so?

{"article_number": 1215, "article_idx": 6, "article_text": " The second question was answered in short order, when BuzzFeed posted a PDF of the 35-page dossier a little after 6 p.m Even in their posting, BuzzFeed acknowledged some misgivings about the document, admitting that it was full of unverified claims “It is not just unconfirmed: It includes some clear errors,” the story noted Verified or not, the claims were highly explosive, and in some cases quite graphic Because they are not verified, I will not summarize them here, though they can be read at BuzzFeed or in any other number of places      Other reporting, including from my colleague Rosie Gray, has already begun to poke holes in the assertions contained in the dossier Trump denied the report on Twitter, writing, “FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!” Now that the documents are in the public domain, the work under way within some news organizations to suss out what is true in the report will likely accelerate      Sensing that the decision to publish would be controversial, BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith wrote a memo to staff explaining the thinking, and then posted it on Twitter      “Our presumption is to be transparent in our journalism and to share what we have with our readers We have always erred on the side of publishing In this case, the document was in wide circulation at the highest levels of American government and media,” Smith wrote “Publishing this document was not an easy or simple call, and people of good will may disagree with our choice But publishing the dossier reflects how we see the job of reporters in 2017.”      Smith alluded to the document’s wide circulation, a nod to the fact that many outlets have either acquired or been offered the chance to view it—a group that includes CNN, Politico (whose Ken Vogel said he’d chased the story), and Lawfare David Corn of Mother Jones also published a story based on information collected by the British intelligence operative in October      Smith’s reasoning is sincere and considered, but the conclusion is highly dubious Even more perturbing was the reasoning in the published story “Now BuzzFeed News is publishing the full document so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the US government,” the story stated      That raises a range of potential objections First, it unfairly forces a public figure—Trump, in this case—to respond to a set of allegations that might or might not be entirely scurrilous; the reporters, by their own admission, do not know Second, the appeal to “transparency” notwithstanding, this represents an abdication of the basic responsibility of journalism The reporter’s job is not to simply dump as much information as possible into the public domain, though that can at times be useful too, as some of WikiLeaks’ revelations have shown It is to gather information, sift through it, and determine what is true and what is not The point of a professional journalist corps is to have people whose job it is to do that work on behalf of society, and who can cultivate sources and expertise to help them adjudicate it A pluralistic press corps is necessary to avoid monolithic thinking among reporters, but transparent transmission of misinformation is no more helpful or clarifying than no information at all ", "summary": "Their publication raises some big questions about journalistic ethics: Why did BuzzFeed decide to pull the trigger on publishing in full (in its words) \"unverified, and potentially unverifiable allegations\"?

105 minutes G Animated Disney/Pixar adventure Coco arrives with joyous Latin music celebrating Mexico’s Day of the Dead festivities, and there’s a real sense of occasion to it — and also one of relief Pixar’s 19th film is its first with a minority lead character: Anthony Gonzalez’s Miguel, a 12-year-old in the tiny old town of Santa Cecilia, where he longs to be a musician in “the only family in Mexico that hates music.” He’s about to discover how far dreams — and nightmares — can roam      Article Continued Below      Coco is also a brilliant original creation by the ’toon titan, although it borrows some supernatural inspiration from Spirited Away by Japan’s Hayao Miyazaki, a favourite of Pixar animators It’s a joy to see the company doing something genuinely creative again, after a pair of cash-in sequels (Cars 3, Finding Dory) and a factory-issue children’s story (The Good Dinosaur) Pixar looked for a while there as if it was content to embrace mediocrity as long as it kept multiplexes full Coco has great bones, and not just the ones belonging to the animated skeletons whom Miguel is about to meet It’s co-directed by Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina, who previously worked together on Toy Story 3, one of Pixar’s grandest achievements The story begins with Miguel lamenting his misfortune of being born into a cobbler’s family He longs to be a guitar-strumming troubadour like his hero, Ernesto de la Cruz, who is voiced to showboating perfection by Benjamin Bratt Ernesto exited the world after a tragic stage accident, while another musician brought misery to Miguel’s family This led to stories about a curse against the family — hence the ban on music, enforced by the watchful Abuelita (Renee Victor) But boys will be ninos, and Miguel’s curious peregrinations land him in the Land of the Dead, located just across a golden bridge strewn with marigolds Turns out it even has its only customs department run by officious skeletons, who really don’t require X-rays to see everything      Hector the skeleton, voiced by Gael Garcia Bernal, right, and Miguel, voiced by Anthony Gonzalez, appear in a scene from the animated film, Coco ( Pixar / AP )      Forced to mimic the dead in other to walk among them, Miguel adopts a disguise and takes up with a precocious pooch and a sad-eyed soul named Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal) They strive to right wrongs, make music and return to the land of the living to be with Miguel’s family, among them the film’s titular Mama Coco (Ana Ofelia Murguia), his frail great-grandmother      Every step of the way in Coco is a visual and sonic delight There’s a shout-out to famed Mexican painter Frida Kahlo that includes someone getting arrested for “impersonating a unibrow.” The action moves swiftly but still manages to picks up amusing details, like an artist sketching a skeleton that on the other side of the golden bridge would surely be a nude model The dialogue blends Spanish and English as naturally as rum and Coke The music is another highlight, especially the heartfelt ballad “Remember Me,” written by Frozen’s Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, that is sure to be an awards contender this season Frozen is also recalled in the accompanying animated Disney short Olaf’s Frozen Adventure, featuring the clownish snowman from that 2013 megahit, but here magic gets put on ice The songs are so anodyne, one of

\"Effervescent, clever and thoughtful,\" Coco \"is Pixar's best effort since 2015's Inside Out and also one of its \"most gorgeously animated outings in some time,\" writes Brian Truitt at USA Today It will \"makes you laugh and cry in equal doses.\" It might have you singing, too Among Pixar's most musical films, Coco sees 13-year-old Anthony Gonzalez shine as main character Miguel \"The kid can sing like nobody's business,\" writes Truitt Justin Chang argues the film is good, not great, missing \"the sense of filmmakers boldly and brilliantly conquering new terrain\" as in Inside Out Viewers might also object to the film's \"breathless velocity,\" he writes at the Los Angeles Times But there are things to appreciate, too, like \"a non-white human protagoninst\" and \"a showstopping musical climax and an ending all but guaranteed to tickle your tear ducts,\" Chang writes \"Progress could certainly look worse.\" \"The action moves swiftly but still manages to picks up amusing details\" in this \"brilliant original creation,\" Peter Howell writes at the Toronto Star He admires much, including dialogue that \"blends Spanish and English as naturally as rum and Coke.\" But it's the sights and sounds of music that take the film to another level, says Howell \"Every step of the way in Coco is a visual and sonic delight.\" \"Despite a slow start … Coco finds its groove\" on a \"delightfully nonlinear path\" through \"fanciful new worlds,\" writes Stephanie Merry at the Washington Post The \"stunning visuals\" cannot be missed \"Some of the animation in Coco is so detailed that it looks photorealistic,\" she writes But mostly, the film feels fresh as it celebrates \"a culture that's so often overlooked by the movie industry,\" addresses death \"in a lighthearted way,\" and tries its hand at dark comedy to much success, Merry writes."}

{"article_number": 5131, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "About 30 minutes into an American Airlines flight from Dallas to Portland, Ore., a flight attendant noticed Chad Cameron Camp, 26, with his hand on a 13-year-old girl's crotch, according to the complaint When the plane landed Camp was arrested and charged with abusive sexual contact (The Washington Post)      The first warning sign came before the plane had even taken off      Chad Cameron Camp had his choice of seats on the half-empty American Airlines flight from Dallas to Portland, Ore But Camp, 26, curiously chose a middle seat — right next to an unaccompanied 13-year-old girl, the FBI said in a statement      Flight attendants offered to move Camp to another seat where he would have more room, but he declined      “No, I’m fine,” he said, according to a criminal complaint obtained by The Washington Post.      When a flight attendant returned for drink service a half hour later, she saw Camp’s hand on the teenager’s crotch, according to the complaint      She also saw “a single tear coming down the victim’s cheek.”      Flight attendants separated Camp and the teenager for the rest of the voyage And as soon as the plane landed, the unaccompanied minor was rushed off the plane      When Camp exited the plane, he was arrested and charged with abusive sexual contact, according to the FBI      The teenager’s attorney, however, says that the airline failed to protect its vulnerable passenger      “This was 30 minutes of hell for this young lady,” said Brent Goodfellow, a lawyer representing the girl, who scoffed at the idea that his client had been saved by a heroic flight attendant      “If I have my tray table down or my seat back two inches during the improper time, those guys are going to be on me immediately,” Goodfellow told The Post “This girl got abused for 30 minutes and no one was to be found.”      [‘I’m not a terrorist but we’re going to die’: Flight diverted due to unruly passenger]      Not only did the airline fail to protect her, he said, but American Airlines also charged the girl’s family extra to let her travel alone      “The family paid $300 extra and this is what they get?” he said, adding that his clients are “absolutely going to sue the airline.”      American Airlines said it takes “these matters very seriously” and is fully cooperating with law enforcement      “American cares deeply about our young passengers and is committed to providing a safe and pleasant travel experience for them,” the airline said in a statement to CNN      As Goodfellow points out, however, this is not the only recent case of a child allegedly being sexually abused aboard an American Airlines flight      In July 2015, a Pakistani doctor was similarly accused of groping an unaccompanied girl aboard an AA flight from New York to Chicago Mohammad Asif Chaudhry, 57, was visiting relatives in the United States last summer when he allegedly moved from his assigned seat to sit next to the girl, who was between 12 and 16 years of age      The girl woke up from a nap to find the doctor inappropriately touching her, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court against Chaudhry and American Airlines      “I can’t move cause the seat belt sign is on and I want to get away,” the girl said in desperate texts to her mother, the Associated Press reported “Mommy, I’m scared.”      [American professor arrested following mid-flight foreign policy rant]      Chaudhry said that the contact was inadvertent, however He was acquitted by a federal judge in November The lawsuit against him and American Airlines continues in an Iowa court      After the incident, American Airlines issued a nearly identical statement to the one last week      “It’s a mockery,” Goodfellow said of the boilerplate statements “It’s like a slap in the face.”            Muhammad Asif Chaudhry, left, leaves the federal courthouse with his attorney right, and a man who accompanied him in court in September 2015, in Chicago (M Spencer Green/AP)      He said the airline’s reaction was also identical: Move the accused man to the back, move the girl to the front and call the FBI, which handles incidents aboard flights      Wednesday’s incident allegedly began brewing the moment Camp boarded the airplane      The girl was flying home to the Portland area after visiting her father in San Antonio She boarded the flight first      Camp was wearing headphones and talking to himself when he sat down in his assigned seat, 21-B, right next to the girl      “The first word out of his mouth was ‘F—,'” the attorney said      If that wasn’t enough of a warning, Goodfellow said, then flight attendants should have realized there was a problem when Camp declined to move to an empty row — or at least to the aisle seat      “That’s a big red flag,” the attorney said “Anybody who has ever flown more than a couple of hours and knows that if there is any empty seat that is not the middle seat, of course they are going to move.”      [Ivy League economist ethnically profiled, interrogated for doing math on American Airlines flight]      Camp mumbled and cursed to himself before attempting to make small talk, according to the complaint He began leaning toward her, forcing her to lean away      Camp then allegedly began brushing up against her upper arm and shoulder while ostensibly turning the pages of a magazine      “Each time he turned the page he used his elbow to brush up against the victim’s shoulder and upper arm area The victim attempted to move away from Camp’s physical contact, and each time she withdrew, he would laugh,” the complaint states “After finishing with the magazine, Camp leaned toward the victim to place the magazine in the seat pocket in front of the victim Camp instead dropped the magazine on the victim’s shoes.”      Later, while pretending to look out the window, Camp leaned across the girl again, putting his face just inches from hers, the complaint continues      When the girl declined Camp’s offer to share his headphones, he allegedly threw them in her lap      Camp then repeatedly placed his hand on the girl’s knee and upper thigh, according to the complaint      “She had to push his hand off of her and cross her legs,” Goodfellow told The Post      “What are you doing?” she asked him But Camp just laughed and did it again, according to the complaint      “She was frightened and trapped,” the complaint says      “She was touched over 15 times,” Goodfellow said      The incident only stopped when a female flight attendant came by to serve drinks and spotted Camp’s hand on the girl’s crotch, according to the complaint      That’s also when the flight attendant noticed that the girl was crying            An American Airlines plane takes off at the Miami International Airport in 2013 (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)      When confronted, Camp denied doing anything wrong, according to the complaint And when the flight attendant told him to move, he initially tried to slide over just one seat, to the aisle, according to Goodfellow Instead, the flight attendant moved Camp to the back of the plane and put the girl near the front      As soon as the plane reached its gate in Portland, the girl was ushered off so that she could meet her stepfather and give a statement to authorities      When Camp exited the plane, he was detained by Port of Portland officials and then arrested by FBI agents, according to a statement from the bureau      Camp later pleaded not guilty, the Oregonian reported      According to the complaint, another passenger on the flight had seen Camp consume “four mixed alcoholic drinks” in an hour while sitting at the airport bar, although he did not appear drunk at the time      Even after Camp’s arrest, the girl’s terrifying ordeal wasn’t over      Before he could be taken to Multnomah County jail, the girl happened to walk past Camp, then detained, on the way to the airport restroom — an experience Goodfellow described as “absolutely traumatizing.”      “She could see Camp [in the airport terminal] and returned to her stepfather frightened and crying,” according to the complaint      The attorney accused American Airlines of “extorting” separated families by charging them extra to let unaccompanied minors travel without providing any meaningful protection      The girl’s father paid an additional $300 round-trip for her to visit him      In August 2014, American Airlines began requiring parents to pay $150 extra each way for unaccompanied minors ages 12-14 to fly Previously, only unaccompanied minors ages 4-11 were required to use the service      “This age range not only ensures the safest possible travel for our youngest customers, it’s consistent with US Airways policy before the close of our merger,” American told its employees, according to the Dallas Morning News      “Our unaccompanied minor service is to ensure your child is boarded onto the aircraft, introduced to the flight attendant, chaperoned during connections and released to the appropriate person at their destination,” the airline’s website states      [UC Berkeley student removed from Southwest flight after speaking Arabic on plane]      “To me, what this is, is American looking for some extra dollars after they’ve got their baggage fees and all the other things they are now hitting us with,” Goodfellow told The Post “If I’m an executive at American Airlines, I’m thinking: Almost half of our marriages in the United States end in divorce, and there are people moving out of state all the time, and there isn’t a dollar figure out there that people aren’t going to pay to see their loved ones.”      “Parents are assuming they are going to be getting bodyguard service” for $300, but they are not, he added      Camp never should have been given a seat next to the girl in the first place, Goodfellow argued He cited some airline policies barring men from sitting next to unaccompanied minors      Those policies have come under attack, however, from men who claim that they are sexist      In 2012, an Australian firefighter said he felt like a “pedophile” when a Virgin Australia flight attendant asked him to move from his seat next to two unaccompanied boys, according to CNN After a public uproar, Virgin said it was reviewing its policy      “Basically, he felt like a pedophile precisely because he was treated like one,” Joshua Gans wrote in Forbes shortly after the incident      Other airlines, including British Airways, Qantas and Air New Zealand have also been criticized for similar policies      Boris Johnson, ex-mayor of London, wrote an op-ed in 2006 about being asked to move on a British Airways flight before he revealed to the flight attendant that the kids were actually his      British Airways changed its policy in 2010 after being successfully sued by Luxembourgian businessman Mirko Fischer, who complained that he had been treated like a “child molester” by the airline, according to the Telegraph      [Stranded by airline, a disabled D.C activist crawled off his flight But the humiliation was far from over.]      Allegations of abuse against unaccompanied minors are relatively rare In 2013, an off-duty Delta pilot was accused of groping an unaccompanied girl on a flight from Detroit to Salt Lake City      Such cases date back to at least 1990, when a Michigan man was arrested for allegedly fondling a 9-year-old girl who was traveling with her 7-year-old sister aboard a Northwest Airlines flight      “Airlines and flight attendants say it’s the first such incident they know of and doubt it could happen except under unusual circumstances,” the Seattle Times reported, noting that the alleged incident happened during an overnight flight when the lights were dimmed      At the same time, however, the newspaper said the incident had “raised a new concern: youngsters being sexually molested en route.”      Goodfellow said airlines don’t necessarily need to revert to bans on men sitting next to unaccompanied minors      He said there are simple, nondiscriminatory steps an airline can take, such as sitting unaccompanied minors in aisle seats in front or rear rows, where they are closest to and most easily seen by flight attendants      Whenever possible, unaccompanied minors should also have an empty seat next to them for protection, he said      On Thursday, Camp appeared briefly in U.S District Court in Portland His attorney entered a not guilty plea on his behalf, the Oregonian reported The attorney could not be reached for comment late Sunday night      No matter the outcome of Camp’s case, Goodfellow said the incident had permanently affected the 13-year-old girl      “She doesn’t want to be on an airplane ever again,” he said “This is going to affect the rest of her life.”      Read also:      ‘We had no hope’: The amazing story of the baby born with his brain outside his skull      Ugly plane ride drives Muslim chaplain to tears      United

(Associated Press)      The judge on Friday called for retired Marine Sgt Andrew Tahmooressi (Tah-mor-EE-si) to be freed because of his mental state and did not make a determination on the illegal arms charges against the Afghanistan veteran diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, according to a Mexican official who had knowledge of the ruling but was not authorized to give his name      Tahmooressi has said he took a wrong turn on a California freeway that funneled him into a Tijuana port of entry with no way to turn back His detention brought calls for his freedom from U.S politicians, veterans groups and social media campaigns      It is with an overwhelming and humbling feeling of relief that we confirm that Andrew was released today after spending 214 days in Mexican Jail, the family said in a statement      U.S Republican and Democratic politicians had held talks with Mexican authorities to urge his release A U.S congressional committee also held a public hearing to pressure Mexico to free him      U.S Rep Ed Royce, R-Calif., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he was elated by the news and that his PTSD will be treated by specialists in the United States He had met with Tahmooressi in jail and talked to Mexico's Jesus Murillo Karam about the case      As I said after visiting Andrew in the Mexican jail, he needs to come home to the United States to be with his mother Jill and the support network of friends I know to be standing by to help him He is a hero who served his country bravely on the battlefields of Afghanistan, which is why so many Americans have been focused on getting him home, Royce said      Former New Mexico Gov Bill Richardson, who grew up in Mexico and has negotiated on a range of international issues, said he met with Tahmooressi in jail in the border city of Tecate, and he had talked to Mexican officials to urge them to release Tahmooressi on humanitarian grounds      I respect Mexico's judicial process, and I am pleased that Andrew was released today and will return home to his family, Richardson in a statement      U.S Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., also applauded his release      As a mother, my heart is with Jill Tahmooressi tonight and I can only imagine the many emotions she must be experiencing, namely the relief in knowing her son is coming home and that they will soon be reunited without prison bars, without handlers and without unnecessary travel, Wasserman Schultz said It is my hope that Andrew can transition back to life in the U.S after this ordeal as soon as possible, including securing the treatment he needs for his post-traumatic stress disorder and being honored for his service to our nation      Mexican authorities, however, had made clear that they would not be influenced by politics and that the matter was in the hands of its courts      In Mexico, possession of weapons restricted for use by the Army is a federal crime, and the country has been tightening up its border checks to stop the flow of US weapons that have been used by drug cartels      His attorney, Fernando Benitez, had pushed for the 26-year-old Florida man to be released because Mexico has no experience in treating combat-related PTSD, even in its own soldiers      Benitez had argued that Tahmooressi carries loaded guns with him because his weapons, which were bought legally in the U.S., make him feel safer He added that the veteran is often distracted, which could have contributed to him becoming lost      Still, Mexican prosecutors maintained Tahmooressi broke the law      Tahmooressi was carrying in his truck a rifle, shotgun, pistol and hundreds of rounds of ammunition      After being jailed in Tijuana, Tahmooressi's mother said, he tried to kill himself by cutting his neck with a shard from a light bulb in his cell because the guards and inmates threatened to rape, torture and kill him and he feared she would be in danger      He was transferred to another prison, where a pastor visited him regularly and the Mexican government says he was under medical observation      But a psychiatrist hired by Mexican prosecutors to examine the Afghanistan veteran agreed with the defense that he should get PTSD treatment in the United States, noting in a Sept 30 report that Tahmooressi, who now serves in the Marine reserve, feels like he is constantly in danger      Tahmooressi did not admit wrongdoing, and he still maintains his innocence, his attorney said      His mother, Jill Tahmooressi, has said her son's time in a Mexican jail has been worse than his two tours in Afghanistan      Tahmooressi left Florida for San Diego in January to get help after dropping out of college, unable to concentrate or sleep, his mother said      The case marks

Aitcheson was a University of Maryland student and Ku Klux Klan member who burned a cross in the front yard of a black newlywed couple’s home He was sentenced to jail time and ordered to pay about $20,000 to the family Then God changed his heart      Aitcheson went on to attend seminary in Rome and was ordained as a Catholic priest He returned home to the East Coast and served in several Virginia parishes, including his most recent post at St Leo the Great in Fairfax City, where he’s been for four years      The Rev William Aitcheson (Arlington Catholic Herald)      Seeing images from the deadly white supremacist and white nationalist rally in Charlottesville spurred Aitcheson to make a confession of his own He wrote an essay published Monday in the Arlington Catholic Herald about his KKK involvement and burning crosses before joining the clergy He said he’s temporarily stepping down from his post      In his essay, Aitcheson described himself as “an impressionable young man” when he joined the hate group He wrote that images from the rally in Charlottesville “brought back memories of a bleak period in my life that I would have preferred to forget.”      It isn’t clear how many at his current or past parishes knew of his KKK involvement, although officials at the Catholic Diocese of Arlington said that when he came to the diocese more than 24 years ago, they “learned of his past as well as his sincere conversion of heart.” They said no accusations of racism have been lodged against him while at the diocese      “My actions were despicable,” wrote Aitcheson, 62 “When I think back on burning crosses, a threatening letter, and so on, I feel as though I am speaking of somebody else It’s hard to believe that was me.”      In a statement, Michael F Burbidge, bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Arlington, called Aitcheson’s past “sad and deeply troubling.”      Aitcheson served with the Catholic Church in Nevada before being transferred to Arlington, where he is originally from, church officials said in a statement He was ordained in 1988 and has served in a variety of positions at parishes in Nevada; Arlington; Fredericksburg; and Warrenton, Va His latest assignment was as parochial vicar, or assistant to the pastor, at St Leo the Great in Fairfax City      The Arlington diocese said Aitcheson would not be available to comment Attempts to reach him Tuesday were unsuccessful      According to a March 1977 story in The Washington Post, Aitcheson, then a 23-year-old University of Maryland student, was identified as an “exalted cyclops” of a KKK lodge He was charged in several cross-burnings in Prince George’s County, one count of making bomb threats and two counts of manufacturing pipe bombs      [From 1977: Maryland student charged in 6 cross burnings]      President Trump addressed U.S troops and the nation from Fort Myer in Arlington, Va., on Aug 21 to announce his plan going forward in Afghanistan (The Washington Post)      According to the 1977 Post article, Maryland State Police said Aitcheson was a leader of the Robert E Lee Lodge of the Maryland Knights of the KKK, which had planned to recruit people to blow up facilities at Fort Meade      When officers searched his home in the 1970s, they found nine pounds of black powder, weapons and bomb parts in Aitcheson’s bedroom and basement His parents told authorities they didn’t know about the explosives and weapons      At the time he was charged in the 1970s, Aitcheson’s father, William W Aitcheson, said his son was a member of the hate group, adding, “My son, along with others, are just caught up in it    I don’t know what their thoughts are.”            Aitcheson pleaded guilty to several cross burnings, including one in the front yard of an African American family in the College Park Woods neighborhood and others at B’nai B’rith Hillel at the University of Maryland and the Beth Torah Congregation in Hyattsville He was convicted, sentenced to 90 days and ordered to pay a judgment of about $20,000      The African American couple declined to talk Tuesday about the burning cross from 40 years ago A woman who answered the door at their Silver Spring home said it was so long ago and that thinking about it would bring back difficult memories      Five years after Aitcheson’s involvement in the cross-burning incident at their home, President Ronald Reagan visited the couple and their young daughter, saying it was “is not something that should have happened in America,” according to a May 1982 article in the Post      Steve Fennell, a partner at Washington law firm Steptoe and Johnson, represented the family in a civil case against Aitcheson He said the cross burning had an “enormous impact” on his former clients, although he hasn’t spoken with them in decades      “The hurt was profound, but the closure they got from the president of the United States was just as profound,” he said      [A Family’s Long Ordeal]      Aitcheson also pleaded guilty to charges that he threatened to kill Coretta Scott King, the widow of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr He told a U.S District Court judge that he wrote to King in February 1976, telling her to “stay off the University of Maryland campus or you will die.” Investigators said he wrote “Africa or death by lynching, take your pick, the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.” He was a U-Md student studying broadcasting at the time      He told a judge he was pleading guilty because “well, ah, because I’m guilty.” He was convicted in U.S District Court in Baltimore of mailing threatening communications A judge sentenced him to 60 days in prison and four years of probation            In his essay published this week, Aitcheson apologized and said the recent violence in Charlottesville prompted him to share his past He called the images from Charlottesville “embarrassing,” adding that “for those who have repented from a damaging and destructive past, the images should bring us to our knees in prayer.”      [Recounting a day of rage, hate, violence and death]      Aitcheson went on: “Racists have polluted minds, twisted by an ideology that reinforces the false belief that they are superior to others.” Aitcheson also wrote that “the irony that” he “left an anti-Catholic hate group to rejoin the Catholic Church is not lost on me It is a reminder of the radical transformation possible through Jesus Christ in his mercy.”      The diocese had received information about Aitcheson’s history when he was officially accepted for ministry in 1998, officials said Billy Atwell, a spokesman for the Catholic Diocese of Arlington, did not detail that information      Atwell said Aitcheson’s background check upon coming to Arlington indicated he hadn’t been convicted of a “barrier crime” under Virginia law, which includes crimes such as murder, robbery, sexual assault or crimes against children      He said more in-depth background reviews have been done routinely on staff and priests since the mid-2000s The checks are conducted using a national criminal check system of FBI and fingerprint-tracking databases      Former and current church officials familiar with the screening process said judgments of priest-candidates are considered on a “case by case basis” and that there is no national or churchwide standard Sexual abuse or sexual crime, however, would eliminate a candidate’s chances      Atwell said Tuesday that Aitcheson’s “story of repentance is authentic.”      The checks are conducted using a national criminal check system of FBI and fingerprint-tracking databases      “The question as to whether someone is fit for ministry is answered within that process,” Atwell wrote in an email After that, he said, a formal recommendation is made to the Bishop and his advisers Aitcheson did undergo other routine procedures, such as a psychological evaluation and multiple interviews      In Nevada, a spokesman for the Diocese of Reno said he only had “general files” about Aitcheson and that those who had made decisions on him becoming a priest have since died      “The diocese accepted him, for whatever reason,” said the Rev Robert Chorey “I have no record of their thought process of anything.”      Asked if the diocese knew about Aitcheson’s KKK and criminal background when they accepted him as a priest, Chorey said, “it seems they understood at least part of his background.” What would disqualify someone from becoming a priest was hard to say, Chorey said, adding that it would be decided on a case-by-case basis He said he didn’t know why Aitcheson decided to go to Nevada      At Fairfax’s Saint Leo the Great, Al Leightley, the church’s head usher, said Aitcheson never discussed his involvement with the KKK Leightley found out about his past Tuesday morning but said Aitcheson repented appropriately in his letter      “He is a very good priest, very dedicated to his profession,” he said “It’s hard to see all the commotion going on with the gentleman.”      Some public Catholic figures began speaking out on Aitcheson on Tuesday, including conservative legal scholar Matthew Franck, a Princeton University lecturer      “I hope this evidently good man returns to active ministry,” Franck tweeted “He could do important work, especially with his history.”      On the diocese’s Facebook page, supporters of the priest praised his decision to go public and called him a gifted pastor “A true story of redemption May God continue to work in and through Fr Aitcheson,” one wrote      In a phone interview, Franck said, “Sometimes people get involved in a hate group and then have been reborn, and have an interesting story to tell … It would be a loss for him to just vanish.”      Some commenters disagreed One woman, Linda Sun, wrote on the comment section of the Arlington Catholic Herald website that while Aitcheson may “feel good” after putting his story more into the public, it’s a “kind of self-indulgence that does little good.”      A note at the bottom of Aitcheson’s essay Monday said he had “voluntarily asked to step away from public ministry, for the well being of the Church and parish community.”      Ellie Silverman, Justin Jouvenal, Magda Jean-Louis and Peter Hermann contributed to this report ", "summary": "Rev He says he was \"an impressionable young man\" at the time and has since been transformed through Jesus' mercy The 62-year-old Aitcheson writes that the events in Charlottesville “brought back memories of a bleak period in my life that I would have preferred to forget.” But he adds: \"We cannot forget, we should not forget.\" In 1977, when Aitcheson was a 23-year-old college student, he was charged with burning six

{"article_number": 3819, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " In the course of one’s life, there are seminal moments that humble us and, in some cases, even bring shame For the past several decades, I have been blessed with the opportunity to serve as a Catholic priest Originally ordained for the Diocese of Reno-Las Vegas, I transferred to my home area here in the Diocese of Arlington      What most people do not know about me is that as an impressionable young man, I was a member of the Ku Klux Klan It’s public information but it rarely comes up My actions were despicable When I think back on burning crosses, a threatening letter, and so on, I feel as though I am speaking of somebody else It’s hard to believe that was me      As a young adult I was Catholic, but in no way practicing my faith The irony that I left an anti-Catholic hate group to rejoin the Catholic Church is not lost on me It is a reminder of the radical transformation possible through Jesus Christ in his mercy      While 40 years have passed, I must say this: I’m sorry To anyone who has been subjected to racism or bigotry, I am sorry I have no excuse, but I hope you will forgive me      The images from Charlottesville brought back memories of a bleak period in my life that I would have preferred to forget The reality is, we cannot forget, we should not forget Our actions have consequences and while I firmly believe God forgave me — as he forgives anyone who repents and asks for forgiveness — forgetting what I did would be a mistake Those mistakes have emboldened me in my journey to follow the God who yearns to give us his grace and redemption      The images from Charlottesville are embarrassing They embarrass us as a country, but for those who have repented from a damaging and destructive past, the images should bring us to our knees in prayer Racists have polluted minds, twisted by an ideology that reinforces the false belief that they are superior to others      Christ teaches something different He teaches us that we are all his creations and wonderfully made — no matter our skin color or ethnicity Realizing this truth is incredibly liberating When I left my former life, I did a lot of soul-searching God humbled me, because I needed to be humbled But abandoning thoughts of racism and superiority gave me the liberation I needed      We must condemn, at every opportunity, the hatred and vile beliefs of the KKK and other white supremacist organizations What they believe directly contradicts what we believe as Americans and what we, as Catholics, hold dear      If there are any white supremacists reading this, I have a message for you: you will find no fulfillment in this ideology Your hate will never be satisfied and your anger will never subside I encourage you to find peace and mercy in the only place where it is authentic and unending: Jesus Christ      I ask that you pray for the victims of racism and bigotry Pray that they would never feel like anything less than children of God, bestowed with dignity and love      Pray also for those who perpetuate racist beliefs and wrongly believe they are superior to others God forgives everyone who truly repents Nobody is outside of his loving grasp With conversion in Christ, they can find new life in the truth      Diocesan Note:      Father William Aitcheson’s article was written with the intention of

{"article_number": 4011, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " LONG POND, Pa — A 41-year-old man was killed Sunday when 10 fans were struck by lightning following the rain-shortened NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Pocono Raceway      The death was confirmed by track president Brandon Igdalsky, who said the fan was pronounced dead at Pocono Medical Center in East Stroudsburg, Pa      Fans had to seek cover under the bleachers as rain fell twice during Sunday's Pennsylvania 400 race (AP Photo)      On Monday, authorities identified the man as Brian Zimmerman of Moosic, Pa      Zimmerman died as he stood near his car in the parking lot behind the frontstretch grandstands near Turn 3, Monroe County coroner Bob Allen said Monday      Allen said Sunday night that Zimmerman, a father of two, was in cardiac arrest when paramedics got to him three minutes after the lightning strike      Igdalsky, whose grandfather, Dr Joe Mattioli, built the track and whose family still owns the track, announced the death about three hours after the race      “Unfortunately a member of our raceway family here, a fan, has passed away,” he said while trying to compose himself “On behalf of myself, the entire family and everybody here, a really heartfelt (condolences) that this happened.”      Zimmerman was treated by doctors at the track’s infield medical center and then taken by ambulance to Pocono Medical Center, where medics were unable to revive him, said Allen, who planned to conduct an autopsy Monday      Nine others were hospitalized, including one in critical condition at Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pa Four others were taken to Pocono Medical Center, one with minor injuries and three for further evaluation, while two (one with moderate injuries, one with minor injuries) were taken to Geisinger Medical Center in Wilkes-Barre, Pa Three fans were taken for further evaluation to Lehigh Valley Hospital-Cedar Crest      The fan in critical condition was injured in the same strike that killed Zimmerman, USA Today reported, citing a Pocono Mountain Regional Police report      Harry Lewis, chief of the Pocono Mountain Regional Police, told USA Today that the fans were with their Dodge Caravan in the parking lot and had a pop-up canopy behind the vehicle      “We are deeply saddened that a fan has died and others were injured by lightning strikes following today’s race at Pocono,” NASCAR spokesman David Higdon said “Our thoughts are with them as well as all those affected by this unfortunate accident.”      Pocono spokesman Bob Pleban said Sunday he could not release the names of those injured, who were hit during a massive thunderstorm that forced the race to be halted after 98 of 160 laps      Pleban said warnings about lightning in the area were issued over the public address system immediately after the race was stopped The National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the area at 4:12 p.m ET and the race was not stopped for another 30 minutes when the rain came      NASCAR spokesman Kerry Tharp said NASCAR takes into consideration the threat of lightning when deciding whether to stop a race and when to declare it over NASCAR officials waited until the track was soaked to pull cars off the track Sunday because they hoped that having cars on the track could potentially keep heat in the surface and allow racing to continue quickly if the storm passed      “If there was a situation that warranted us to halt a race to threatening weather, we would certainly do that,” Tharp said      Jeff Gordon was declared the winner of the race soon after the rain started      Kyle Manger, a spectator from New Jersey, said he saw people hit by the lightning near the Turn 3 grandstands      “Me and my friend just ran into our truck during all the nasty weather,” Manger said “The visibility was very poor and all of a sudden (I) saw a bolt of lightning right in front of our windshield      “When it became a little more visible, we saw two bodies next to a destroyed tent with people scrambling.”      Manger said the lightning strike occurred about five to 10 minutes after the race was called      Gordon said the lightning was bad as he walked from his car on pit road when the race was stopped      “I'm pretty sure I know which one it was,” Gordon said about the lightning strike “We were walking down pit road, the umbrellas weren't doing any good, there was a huge, huge crack from lightning You could tell it was very close      “That's the thing that's going to take away from the victory, is the fact that somebody was affected by that.”      Pocono Raceway plays host to two Cup races each year, and fans are accustomed to rain and severe weather NASCAR estimated Sunday's attendance at 85,000      “The fans here are so loyal and avid,” Gordon said “When we were going back to the garage area (after the race), there was a group of fans chanting up there that were not leaving      “That's just so unfortunate because they're so loyal and avid here, so you hate to hear something like that Certainly our thoughts are with them I hope everything is OK there.” ", "summary": "The race was called

A conservative activist and the organizations she leads have paid several thousand dollars for the ads to run on at least 30 city buses for a month The ads point to a website called RefugefromIslam.com, which offers information to those wishing to leave Islam, but some Muslims are calling the ads a smoke screen for an anti-Muslim agenda      Pamela Geller, who leads an organization called Stop Islamization of America, said the ads were meant to help provide resources for Muslims who are fearful of leaving the faith      It's not offensive to Muslims, it's religious freedom, she said It's not targeted at practicing Muslims It doesn't say 'leave,' it says 'leaving' with a question mark      Geller said the ad buy cost about $8,000, contributed by the readers of her blog, Atlas Shrugs, and other websites Similar ads have run on buses in Miami, and she said ad buys were planned for other cities      Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said Geller's ad was reviewed and did not violate the agency's guidelines      The religion in question would not change the determination that the language in the ad does not violate guidelines, MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz said Wednesday      All ads are screened, MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan said Most are reviewed by the company that handles the MTA's advertising opportunities, but some are sent to the MTA for ultimate approval      Last month, Miami-Dade Transit pulled the ads from 10 buses after deciding they may be offensive to Islam, according to The Miami Herald But the agency decided to reinstall them after reviewing the ads with the county attorney's office      The county decided although they may be considered offensive by some, they do not fall under the general guidelines that would warrant their removal, Transit spokesman Clinton Forbes told the newspaper      Glenn Smith, a professor at California Western School of Law in San Diego, said discriminating against the ads could result in First Amendment issues for the city      While people may find the content objectionable, courts have ruled that the First Amendment requires Americans to put up with a lot of unenlightened and objectionable messages, he said      It's sort of the price of keeping government out of the marketplace of ideas, he said      Eugene Volokh, a First Amendment expert at UCLA School of Law, said the ads could leave some Muslims reluctant to ride the bus There could also be a risk that some extremist groups might bomb the buses, although that possibility wouldn't limit free speech rights, he said      The agency had received no complaints since the ads went up on May 14, MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan said The 30 or so buses with the ads pass through all five boroughs of the city      Council member Robert Jackson, a Muslim, said he had not seen the ad But he questioned the criteria the MTA uses in determining what is appropriate      He also takes issue with the content He doesn't believe anyone is being forced to stay in a religion, especially in America, which was built on religious freedom      I think this is a campaign by the extreme right, those that are against the Muslim religion, he said Quite frankly, I would think the average New Yorker would take it for what it's worth      Faiza Ali, of the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the ads were based on a false premise that people face coercion to remain with Islam She said Muslims believe faith that is forced is not true belief      Geller is free to say what she likes just as concerned community members are free to criticize her motives, Ali said      Geller has a history of speaking out against Muslims, and the ads are a smoke screen to advance her long-standing history of anti-Muslim bigotry, Ali said      Geller said she had no problem with Muslims, but was working to maintain the separation of mosque and state She is also among those speaking out against the building of a mosque and cultural center near ground zero      Copyright © 2010 The Associated Press All rights reserved ", "summary": "The ads then refer people to a website that decries 'the falsity of Islam,' reports the Daily News \"It's not offensive to Muslims, it's religious freedom,\" she tells the AP", "summary_all": "– A New York City blogger is launching a crusade against \"the Islamization of America\" —using the sides of 40 NYC buses \"Fatwa on your head?

{"article_number": 2763, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " Update: Three hours after the publication of this story, Schneiderman resigned from his position “While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work at this critical time,” he said in a statement “I therefore resign my office, effective at the close of business on May 8, 2018.”      Eric Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, has long been a liberal Democratic champion of women’s rights, and recently he has become an outspoken figure in the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment As New York State’s highest-ranking law-enforcement officer, Schneiderman, who is sixty-three, has used his authority to take legal action against the disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein, and to demand greater compensation for the victims of Weinstein’s alleged sexual crimes Last month, when the Times and this magazine were awarded a joint Pulitzer Prize for coverage of sexual harassment, Schneiderman issued a congratulatory tweet, praising “the brave women and men who spoke up about the sexual harassment they had endured at the hands of powerful men.” Without these women, he noted, “there would not be the critical national reckoning under way.” Now Schneiderman is facing a reckoning of his own As his prominence as a voice against sexual misconduct has risen, so, too, has the distress of four women with whom he has had romantic relationships or encounters They accuse Schneiderman of having subjected them to nonconsensual physical violence All have been reluctant to speak out, fearing reprisal But two of the women, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, have talked to The New Yorker on the record, because they feel that doing so could protect other women They allege that he repeatedly hit them, often after drinking, frequently in bed and never with their consent Manning Barish and Selvaratnam categorize the abuse he inflicted on them as “assault.” They did not report their allegations to the police at the time, but both say that they eventually sought medical attention after having been slapped hard across the ear and face, and also choked Selvaratnam says that Schneiderman warned her he could have her followed and her phones tapped, and both say that he threatened to kill them if they broke up with him (Schneiderman’s spokesperson said that he “never made any of these threats.”) A third former romantic partner of Schneiderman’s told Manning Barish and Selvaratnam that he also repeatedly subjected her to nonconsensual physical violence, but she told them that she is too frightened of him to come forward (The New Yorker has independently vetted the accounts that they gave of her allegations.) A fourth woman, an attorney who has held prominent positions in the New York legal community, says that Schneiderman made an advance toward her; when she rebuffed him, he slapped her across the face with such force that it left a mark that lingered the next day She recalls screaming in surprise and pain, and beginning to cry, and says that she felt frightened She has asked to remain unidentified, but shared a photograph of the injury with The New Yorker In a statement, Schneiderman said, “In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity I have not assaulted anyone I have never engaged in nonconsensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.”      Manning Barish was romantically involved with Schneiderman from the summer of 2013 until New Year’s Day in 2015 Selvaratnam was with him from the summer of 2016 until the fall of 2017 Both are articulate, progressive Democratic feminists in their forties who live in Manhattan They work and socialize in different circles, and although they have become aware of each other’s stories, they have only a few overlapping acquaintances; to this day, they have never spoken to each other Over the past year, both watched with admiration as other women spoke out about sexual misconduct But, as Schneiderman used the authority of his office to assume a major role in the #MeToo movement, their anguish and anger grew In February, four months after the first stories about Weinstein broke, Schneiderman announced that his office was filing a civil-rights suit against him At a press conference, he denounced Weinstein, saying, “We have never seen anything as despicable as what we’ve seen right here.” On May 2nd, at the direction of Governor Andrew Cuomo, Schneiderman launched an investigation into the past handling of criminal complaints against Weinstein by the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, Jr., and the New York City Police Department (In 2015, Vance declined to bring criminal charges against Weinstein, saying that he lacked sufficient evidence—a decision criticized by activist groups.) In a speech, Cuomo explained that “sexual-assault complaints must be pursued aggressively, and to the fullest extent of the law.” The expanding investigation of the Weinstein case puts Schneiderman at the center of one of the most significant sexual-misconduct cases in recent history Schneiderman’s activism on behalf of feminist causes has increasingly won him praise from women’s groups On May 1st, the New York-based National Institute for Reproductive Health honored him as one of three “Champions of Choice” at its annual fund-raising luncheon Accepting the award, Schneiderman said, “If a woman cannot control her body, she is not truly equal.” But, as Manning Barish sees it, “you cannot be a champion of women when you are hitting them and choking them in bed, and saying to them, ‘You’re a fucking whore.’ ” She says of Schneiderman’s involvement in the Weinstein investigation, “How can you put a perpetrator in charge of the country’s most important sexual-assault case?” Selvaratnam describes Schneiderman as “a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde” figure, and says that seeing him lauded as a supporter of women has made her “feel sick,” adding, “This is a man who has staked his entire career, his personal narrative, on being a champion for women publicly But he abuses them privately He needs to be called out.” Manning Barish notes that many of her friends attended the N.I.R.H luncheon “His hypocrisy is epic,” she says “He’s fooled so many people.” Manning Barish includes herself among them She says that she met Schneiderman in July, 2013, through mutual friends She had become a blogger and political activist after opposing her younger brother’s deployment to Iraq and working with groups such as MoveOn.org Amicably divorced from Chris Barish, a hospitality-industry executive, she was a single mother with a young daughter and socially prominent friends Schneiderman, who was rising in Democratic politics after being elected attorney general, in 2010, was also divorced His ex-wife, Jennifer Cunningham, a lobbyist and political strategist at the firm SKDKnickerbocker, currently serves as one of his political consultants They have a grown daughter Manning Barish says that she fell quickly for Schneiderman and was happy to be involved with someone who seemed to share her progressive idealism and enjoy her feistiness Page Six chronicled the romance, calling her a “ravishing redhead” and noting that, at a fund-raiser, the television producer Norman Lear had introduced her as Schneiderman’s “bride-to-be.” But Manning Barish began to see signs of controlling and abusive behavior Soon after she started dating Schneiderman, he told her to remove a small tattoo from her wrist; it wasn’t appropriate, he said, if she were to become the wife of a politician The process of having it removed was painful and expensive In retrospect, she says, it was the first step in trying to control her body “Taking a strong woman and tearing her to pieces is his jam,” she says About four weeks after they became physically involved, she says, Schneiderman grew violent One night, they were in the bedroom of his Upper West Side apartment, still clothed but getting ready for bed, and lightly baiting each other As she recalls it, he called her “a whore,” and she talked back They had both been drinking, and her recollection of their conversation is blurry, but what happened next remains vivid Schneiderman, she says, backed her up to the edge of his bed “All of a sudden, he just slapped me, open-handed and with great force, across the face, landing the blow directly onto my ear,” Manning Barish says “It was horrendous It just came out of nowhere My ear was ringing I lost my balance and fell backward onto the bed I sprang up, but at this point there was very little room between the bed and him I got up to try to shove him back, or take a swing, and he pushed me back down He then used his body weight to hold me down, and he began to choke me The choking was very hard It was really bad I kicked In every fibre, I felt I was being beaten by a man.” She finally freed herself and got back on her feet “I was crying and in shock,” she says She recalls shouting, “Are you crazy?” To her astonishment, Schneiderman accused her of scratching him At one point—she can’t remember if it was at this moment or in a later conversation—he told her, “You know, hitting an officer of the law is a felony.” After the incident, Manning Barish left the apartment, telling him that she would never come back “I want to make it absolutely clear,” she says “This was under no circumstances a sex game gone wrong This did not happen while we were having sex I was fully dressed and remained that way It was completely unexpected and shocking I did not consent to physical assault.” In the following days, Manning Barish confided to three close female friends that Schneiderman had hit her All of them have confirmed this to The New Yorker “She was distraught,” one of the friends, a high-profile media figure, says “She was very, very upset This wasn’t a gentle smack He clocked her ear I was shocked.” She notes, “Michelle had mentioned that he drank a lot, and that he changed under the influence of alcohol, but I’d never anticipated that he would be violent.” The friend describes Manning Barish as having seemed “sad” and “torn,” because “she’d really wanted the relationship to work.” The novelist Salman Rushdie, who dated Manning Barish before Schneiderman did, and who has been her close friend for nearly fifteen years, says that she confided in him as well “She called me and told me he had hit her,” Rushdie recalls “She was obviously very upset I was horrified.” In his view, Schneiderman’s behavior does not fall into the kind of gray area that should remain private “It was clear to me that it crossed a line,” he says Rushdie, who describes Manning Barish as “a very truthful person, in my experience,” advised her to stay away from Schneiderman But Manning Barish went back to him, a decision that she regrets After the attack, she says, Schneiderman “called and called” her A few days later, on a weekday afternoon, his security detail drove him to her apartment, and he showed up at her door with an armload of flowers and a case of wine She found the wine surprising, given the fact that alcohol had fuelled his violent behavior She recalls saying over and over, “You hit me! You hurt me! You should never hit a woman!” But he didn’t want to talk about having hit her “The hitting was not an issue for him,” she says Before long, they reconciled Manning Barish says that her ear bothered her for months It often felt painful and clogged, and she kept hearing odd gurgling sounds Once, blood trickled out, reaching her collarbone Eventually, Manning Barish sought medical help from Dr Gwen Korovin, an ear, nose, and throat specialist Manning Barish shared her medical records with The New Yorker They confirm that, on September 13, 2014, Korovin found and removed “dried bloody crust” from Manning Barish’s ear Manning Barish thought that the slap might have caused the injury, but when Korovin asked her what had happened she said that she might have injured herself with a Q-tip “I was protecting Eric,” Manning Barish says “And I was ashamed For victims, shame plays a huge role in most of these stories I want people to know that.” Korovin was asked by The New Yorker if the injury could have been caused by a slap “Yes, it could be consistent with a slap,” she said “You could perforate an eardrum in a lot of ways, with a Q-tip or with a slap.” Manning Barish and Schneiderman were together, off and on, for nearly two years She says that when they had sex he often slapped her across the face without her consent, and that she felt “emotionally battered” by cruel remarks that he made She says that he criticized how she looked and dressed, and “controlled what I ate.” Manning Barish, who is five feet seven, lost thirty pounds, falling to a hundred and three In a photograph from the period, she looks emaciated; her hair, she recalls, started to fall out Nevertheless, he squeezed her legs and called them “chubby.” Manning Barish says that Schneiderman pressed her to consume huge amounts of alcohol She recalls, “I would come over for dinner An already half-empty bottle of red wine would be on the counter He had had a head start ‘Very stressful day,’ he would say.” Sometimes, if she didn’t drink quickly enough, she says, he would “come to me like a baby who wouldn’t eat its food, and hold the glass to my lips while holding my face, and sweetly but forcefully, like a parent, say, ‘Come on, Mimi, drink, drink, drink,’ and essentially force me—at times actually spilling it down my chin and onto my chest.” Schneiderman, she recalls, “would almost always drink two bottles of wine in a night, then bring a bottle of Scotch into the bedroom He would get absolutely plastered five nights out of seven.” On one occasion, she recalls, “he literally fell on his face in my kitchen, straight down, like a tree falling.” Another evening, he smashed his leg against an open drawer, cutting it so badly that “there was blood all over the place.” She bandaged it, but the next day she went to his office to change the dressing, because the bleeding hadn’t stopped Manning Barish says that Schneiderman also took prescription tranquillizers, and often asked her to refill a prescription that she had for Xanax, so that he could reserve “about half” the pills for himself (Schneiderman’s spokesperson said that he has “never commandeered anyone’s medications.”) Sometimes in bed, she recalls, he would be “shaking me and grabbing my face” while demanding that she repeat such things as “I’m a little whore.” She says that he also told her, “If you ever left me, I’d kill you.” Evan Stark, a forensic social worker and an emeritus professor at Rutgers, is the author of a landmark book, “Coercive Control,” in which he argues that domestic abuse is just as often psychological as it is physical Abusive men, he writes, often “terrorize” and “control” their partners by demeaning them, particularly about the traits or accomplishments of which they are proudest Manning Barish says that Schneiderman often mocked her political activism When she told him of her plan to attend an anti-gun demonstration with various political figures and a group of parents from Sandy Hook Elementary School, he dismissed the effort, calling the demonstrators “losers.” He added, “Go ahead, if it makes you feel better to do your little political things.” When she was using her computer, he’d sometimes say, “Oh, look at little Mimi So cute—she’s working!” He told Manning Barish that, because she had childcare, she wasn’t “a real single mother.” Manning Barish broke up with Schneiderman a second time, and then got back together with him He’d been talking about marrying her, she says, and she somehow convinced herself that the real problem between them was her fear of commitment In January, 2015, she ended the relationship a third time, feeling degraded After that, they got together romantically a few more times, but since 2016 she has been in touch with him only sporadically Since the #MeToo movement began, Manning Barish has been active on social-media platforms, cheering on women who have spoken out, including those whose accusations prompted the resignation of the Minnesota senator Al Franken, a widely admired Democrat Once, she made an oblique reference to Schneiderman on social media, in connection with a political issue He called her and, in a tone that she describes as “nasty,” said, “Don’t ever write about me You don’t want to do that.” Manning Barish says that she took his remarks as a threat, just as she took seriously a comment that he’d once made after she objected to him “yanking” her across a street She recalls saying to him, “Jaywalking is against the law,” and him responding, “I am the law.” Manning Barish says, “If there is a sentence that sums him up, it’s that.”      Schneiderman was elected to the New York State Senate in 1998, and served for twelve years He wrote many laws, including one that created specific penalties for strangulation He introduced the bill in 2010, after chairing a committee that investigated domestic-violence charges against the former state senator Hiram Monserrate, a Democrat, who was expelled from the legislature after having been convicted of assaulting his girlfriend During the hearings, the legislators learned that New York State imposed no specific criminal penalty for choking, even though it is a common prelude to domestic-violence homicides Not only did Schneiderman’s bill make life-threatening strangulation a grave crime; it also criminalized less serious cases involving “an intent to impede breathing” as misdemeanors punishable by up to a year in prison “I’m just sorry it took us so long in New York State to do this,” Schneiderman declared at the time “I think this will save a lot of lives.” Jennifer Friedman, a legal expert on domestic violence, says that she cannot square Schneiderman’s public and private behavior Anyone knowledgeable about intimate-partner violence, she says, knows that choking is “a known lethality indicator.” She adds, “I cannot fathom that someone who drafted the legislation on strangulation is unfamiliar with such concepts.” She also says, “A slap is not just a slap—it reverberates through the rest of the relationship, making her afraid of setting him off.” She adds, “People aren’t usually prosecuted for it, but, in the state of New York, slapping is assault when it results in pain or physical injury.” In the summer of 2016, the attorney general may have crossed this line again He went to a party in the Hamptons, where he drank heavily, and invited another guest—a woman he’d known for some time—to join him at an after-party An accomplished Ivy League-educated lawyer with government experience, she had worked closely with his office in the past, and supported him politically She says that she agreed to let a man in Schneiderman’s security detail drive them to the next destination But, when they arrived at the house, there was no party; it was where Schneiderman was staying The security officer left the property The lawyer and Schneiderman began making out, but he said things that repelled her He told the woman, a divorced mother, that professional women with big jobs and children had so many decisions to make that, when it came to sex, they secretly wanted men to take charge She recalls him saying, “Yeah, you act a certain way and look a certain way, but I know that at heart you are a dirty little slut You want to be my whore.” He became more sexually aggressive, but she was repulsed by his talk, and pulled away from him She says that “suddenly—at least, in my mind’s eye—he drew back, and there was a moment where I was, like, ‘What’s happening?’ ” Then, she recalls, “He slapped me across the face hard, twice,” adding, “I was stunned.” Schneiderman hit her so hard, she says, that the blow left a red handprint “What the fuck did you just do?” she screamed, and started to sob “I couldn’t believe it,” she recalls “For a split second, I was scared.” She notes that, in all her years of dating, she has never been in a situation like the one with Schneiderman “He just really smacked me,” she says When she told him that she wanted to leave, she recalls, he started to “freak out,” saying that he’d misjudged her “You’d really be surprised,” he claimed “A lot of women like it They don’t always think they like it, but then they do, and they ask for more.” She again demanded to be taken home They got into his car, and it quickly became apparent how intoxicated he was As he drove, weaving along back roads, she was terrified that he’d kill not just her but another driver She says that Schneiderman “broke the law at least once that night.” (“This is untrue,” Schneiderman’s spokesperson said.) The next day, she told two friends, and sent them a photograph of the mark on her face (Both women corroborate this.) Another photograph of the lawyer, taken later that day at a family birthday party, shows faint raised marks splayed on her cheek One of the friends says of Schneiderman, “He seemed not to know what the word ‘consent’ means.” Given the woman’s prominence in the legal sphere, Schneiderman’s actions had exposed him to tremendous risk Yet she took no official action against him “Now that I know it’s part of a pattern, I think, God, I should have reported it,” she says “But, back then, I believed that it was a one-time incident And I thought, He’s a good attorney general, he’s doing good things I didn’t want to jeopardize that.” She notes that he did not hit her again, after she protested Nevertheless, she says of the assault, “I knew it was wrong,” adding, “Our top law officer, this guy with a platform for women’s rights, just smacked away so much of what I thought he stood for.”      Tanya Selvaratnam is the author of “The Big Lie: Motherhood, Feminism, and the Reality of the Biological Clock,” which explores infertility issues; she is also an actor and a film producer, as well as a supporter of feminist and progressive social causes She, too, is divorced In 2016, she attended the Democratic National Convention, in Philadelphia, where Schneiderman introduced himself to her She says that their first encounter felt “like kismet.” They had both gone to Harvard: she as an undergraduate and a graduate student, he as a law student She was impressed when he expressed an interest in meditation and Buddhism They had both studied Chinese, and, when he asked, in Mandarin, if she spoke the language, she answered, “Wo shuo keshi bu tai liuli”—“Yes, but not fluently.” They began dating, and appeared to be a happy couple Selvaratnam all but lived in his apartment, attending political functions and dinners with his friends and donors, and brainstorming with him on speeches and projects But, as she puts it, “it was a fairy tale that became a nightmare.” Although Schneiderman often doted on her, he demanded that she spend more and more time with him, and he began physically abusing her in bed “The slaps started after we’d gotten to know each other,” she recalls “It was at first as if he were testing me Then it got stronger and harder.” Selvaratnam says, “It wasn’t consensual This wasn’t sexual playacting This was abusive, demeaning, threatening behavior.” When Schneiderman was violent, he often made sexual demands “He was obsessed with having a threesome, and said it was my job to find a woman,” she says “He said he’d have nothing to look forward to if I didn’t, and would hit me until I agreed.” (She had no intention of having a threesome.) She recalls, “Sometimes, he’d tell me to call him Master, and he’d slap me until I did.” Selvaratnam, who was born in Sri Lanka, has dark skin, and she recalls that “he started calling me his ‘brown slave’ and demanding that I repeat that I was ‘his property.’ ” The abuse escalated Schneiderman not only slapped her across the face, often four or five times, back and forth, with his open hand; he also spat at her and choked her “He was cutting off my ability to breathe,” she says Eventually, she says, “we could rarely have sex without him beating me.” In her view, Schneiderman “is a misogynist and a sexual sadist.” She says that she often asked him to stop hurting her, and tried to push him away At other times, she gave in, rationalizing that she could tolerate the violence if it happened only once a week or so during sex But “the emotional and verbal abuse started increasing,” she says, and “the belittling and demeaning of me carried over into our nonsexual encounters.” He told her to get plastic surgery to remove scars on her torso that had resulted from an operation to remove cancerous tumors He criticized her hair and said that she should get breast implants and buy different clothes He mocked some of her friends as “ditzes,” and, when these women attended a birthday celebration for her, he demanded that she leave just as the cake was arriving “I began to feel like I was in Hell,” she says Like Manning Barish, Selvaratnam says that Schneiderman routinely drank heavily—a bottle and a half of wine, or more He also took sedatives, she says, and pushed her to drink with him, saying, “Drink your bourbon, Turnip”—his nickname for her In the middle of the night, he staggered through the apartment, as if in a trance “I’ve never seen anyone that messed up,” she recalls “It was like sleeping next to a monster.” The next morning, she says, he’d seem fine, but often berated her for not having kept him away from the alcohol His emotional state seemed to worsen after the 2016 Presidential election He had counted on forging an ambitious partnership with a White House led by Hillary Clinton Instead, the Presidency had gone to Donald Trump Earlier, Schneiderman’s office had sued Trump University for civil fraud, and Trump had countersued Schneiderman personally On the morning of January 19, 2017, the day before Trump’s Inauguration, Schneiderman called Selvaratnam from a hospital emergency room She recalls, “He told me that he’d been drinking the night before, and he fell down He didn’t realize he’d cut himself, and got into bed, and when he woke up he was in a pool of blood.” Selvaratnam rushed to the hospital Schneiderman had several stitches above his left eye; his face was puffy and bruised He had her send his press secretary a photograph of the injury, and they agreed to cancel a public appearance In the image, which was shared with The New Yorker, Schneiderman has a black eye and a bandage across the left side of his forehead Schneiderman then called Cunningham, his ex-wife and political consultant, and they agreed that he and Selvaratnam should tell anyone who asked about the injury that he had fallen “while running.” (A spokesperson for Schneiderman said, “One morning, Mr Schneiderman fell in the bathroom while completely sober, hit his head, and had to go the E.R for stitches Because he was embarrassed to tell his staff he fell in the bathroom, he told them he fell while running.” Cunningham, in a statement issued shortly after this story was published online, said, “I’ve known Eric for nearly thirty-five years as a husband, father, and friend These allegations are completely inconsistent with the man I know, who has always been someone of the highest character, outstanding values, and a loving father I find it impossible to believe these allegations are true.”) Selvaratnam understands how incomprehensible it may seem that she stayed in such an abusive relationship for more than a year But, she says, “now I see how independent women get stuck in one.” The physical abuse, she notes, “happens quickly”: “He’s drunk, and you’re naked and at your most vulnerable It’s so disorienting You lose a little of who you are.” She kept telling herself that she could help him change, and tried to get him to see a therapist At times, she blamed herself for his behavior “I was scared what he might do if I left him,” she says “He had said he would have to kill me if we broke up, on multiple occasions He also told me he could have me followed and could tap my phone.” It’s unclear if Schneiderman was serious when he made such remarks, but Selvaratnam says that she felt intimidated Jacquelyn Campbell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, is the author of a danger-assessment checklist that helps authorities gauge the likelihood of homicide in domestic-violence situations She says, “It’s often true that women don’t know whether to take threats to kill seriously But we should always take threats seriously It’s categorized as a violent act, and you can report someone to the police for it.” Selvaratnam began to spend more time apart from Schneiderman, and last fall she ended the relationship She’d been suffering from ringing in her ears, and sometimes had vertigo After the breakup, she, like Manning Barish, sought medical help from an ear, nose, and throat specialist The doctor could find no specific cause for her ailments The writer Danzy Senna, a close friend of Selvaratnam’s, recalls, “She was thin, fragile, and shaky.” Selvaratnam confided to Senna about the abuse, and Senna was so shocked that she wrote down the details and e-mailed the account to her husband, so that there would be a dated copy of it should any harm come to her friend Senna’s document, which she shared with The New Yorker, is dated September 16, 2017, and says, in part, “She told me that her boyfriend of a year, Eric Schneiderman, the Attorney General of New York, has been choking, beating, and threatening her for the entirety of their relationship, and that several times he threatened to have her killed if she ever tried to leave him She said he knows that she has a lot of really damning information about him, his alcoholism, sexual deviance, and drug use, and she worries about her safety.” Senna advised Selvaratnam to retrieve her belongings from his apartment On November 3, 2017, she did so, with another friend—Jennifer Gonnerman, a staff writer at this magazine As they carried her things outside, they talked about the fact that Selvaratnam couldn’t possibly be the only woman who had seen this side of Schneiderman Gonnerman asked her who else he had dated Selvaratnam knew of one former girlfriend—not Manning Barish—and described where she had worked The next day, Gonnerman happened to run into a male friend who had once worked with the former girlfriend Gonnerman asked him if he’d ever known anyone who had dated Schneiderman He said yes: a close friend of his had Without divulging anything, Gonnerman asked, “So how did that work out?” He answered, “He used to spit on her and slap her during sex.” Gonnerman told Selvaratnam about the other victim “She was very traumatized,” Gonnerman recalls “On the one hand, she was relieved to learn it had happened before, but on the other it was, like, ‘Why hasn’t anyone stopped him?’ ” Selvaratnam says, “I wished someone had warned me And I wondered, Who’s next?” She notes, “I was not planning to come forward, until I found out there was another woman The silence of women before me meant that I’d suffered, too I felt, I will not be able to live with myself if I hear of him doing this to another woman years or months from now.” Selvaratnam reached out to the former girlfriend, and they agreed to meet In February, Selvaratnam recalls, they sat outside on a bench for ninety minutes, and their stories came flooding forth Selvaratnam says that she was astounded to discover how similar their experiences had been Selvaratnam kept notes about her exchanges with the former girlfriend, and she described them to The New Yorker According to these notes, the former girlfriend told Selvaratnam that she had been in love with Schneiderman, but that in bed he had routinely slapped her hard across the ear and the face, as tears rolled down her cheeks He also choked her and spat at her Not all the abuse had taken place in a sexual context She said that Schneiderman had once slapped her during an argument they’d had while getting dressed to go out The blow left a handprint on her back; the next day, the spot still hurt When the former girlfriend objected to this mistreatment, he told her that she simply wasn’t “liberated” enough Just as Schneiderman had done with the other women, he had pushed her to drink with him and to set up a threesome, and he had belittled her work and appearance, saying in her case that she had fat legs and needed Botox After the former girlfriend ended the relationship, she told several friends about the abuse A number of them advised her to keep the story to herself, arguing that Schneiderman was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose She described this response as heartbreaking And when Schneiderman heard that she had turned against him, she said, he warned her that politics was a tough and personal business, and that she’d better be careful She told Selvaratnam that she had taken this as a threat The former girlfriend told Selvaratnam she found it “shameless” that Schneiderman was casting himself as a leading supporter of the #MeToo movement She promised to support Selvaratnam if she spoke out, but she wasn’t sure that she could risk joining her The former girlfriend told Selvaratnam she’d once been so afraid of Schneiderman that she’d written down an extensive account of the abuse, locked the document in a safe-deposit box, and given keys to two friends ", "summary": "", "summary_all": "– A New York lawyer said he told Trump attorney Michael Cohen years ago that former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was abusing women, reports the AP Schneiderman, a frequent legal nemesis of the president, resigned this week after the New Yorker published the accounts of four women who said they were slapped and choked by the Democratic ex-prosecutor Attorney Peter Gleason said in a letter filed with a federal judge Friday that he was contacted \"some years ago\" by two women who claimed Schneiderman was \"sexually inappropriate\" with them Gleason said he advised the women not to report what happened to prosecutors Instead, he said, he discussed the matter with the retired New York Post columnist Stephen Dunleavy According to Gleason, Dunleavy offered to talk about the issue with Trump, then not yet president Gleason said he then got a call from Cohen and \"shared with him certain details\" of Schneiderman's \"vile attacks\" on the women In his letter, Gleason asked US District Judge Kimba Wood to issue a protective order sealing all relevant correspondence with Cohen In a phone interview Friday, Gleason confirmed that Cohen told him during their 2013 conversation that if Trump were elected governor, he would make the allegations about Schneiderman public He added that shortly after that conversation, Trump tweeted about Schneiderman \"Weiner is gone Spitzer is gone - next will be lightweight A.G Eric Schneiderman Is he a crook? Wait and see, worse than Spitzer or Weiner,\" Trump's tweet said, referring to former US Rep Anthony Weiner and former Gov Eliot Spitzer, both of whom resigned because of scandals involving women."}

“Bunny” Ross Jr., who went missing at the age of 18 in Aroostook County nearly 40 years ago, police said Friday      Lt Troy Gardner of the Maine State Police told reporters in Portland, where Ross’ parents now live, that investigators want the author to come forward and talk to police      “There’s no way to know for sure if the letter is truthful or if the information is accurate,” Gardner said “There’s always a possibility that it’s a hoax Obviously, if it is a hoax, that’s a horrible thing to do to somebody who’s been missing their son since 1977.”      Gardner said Ross’ parents, who lived in Fort Kent at the time of his disappearance, received the letter “a few months ago,” but would not disclose any other details about it, including whether it was handwritten or typed, how many pages it was, where it was postmarked or what the writer claimed happened to the missing man      Gardner said police are reluctant to release more information about the letter without learning more about the author and, if the information in the letter is reliable, how that person knows it      Ross went missing on May 12, 1977 That morning, he took a family car from their home in Fort Kent to his aunt’s house in Presque Isle Then, Gardner said Friday, he took another vehicle without permission in Presque Isle      That vehicle was later found in Ashland more than 20 miles away, and Ross was last seen on the Realty Road near the Ashland-Portage town line      “I think the community was shocked,” said his father, Bernard Ross Sr., 80, on Friday morning      “People had a hard time because there were no answers,” Ross’ mother, Carol, 78, said “It’s not like there was a death It was the unknown … There was always the hope that he’d walk through the door one day.”      Carol and Bernard Ross Sr moved to southern Maine in 1981 and lived in Gorham until 2001, when they moved to Portland Carol Ross said Friday that Bunny Ross, one of six children, was “going through some ups and downs” emotionally at the time of his disappearance, but Gardner and the man’s parents on Friday characterized his state of mind as not abnormal for someone in his teenage years      “There’s always been the hope or assumption that he’s alive out there,” Gardner said “Certainly in their minds — and investigatively — there’s been nothing to suggest he’s not alive The other side of that is that he’s been missing since 1977, and that’s a long time to go without contact with family.”      Gardner said he hopes the person who wrote the anonymous letter — or anyone else with information about what happened to Ross — calls state police at 1-800-924-2261 or 532-5400 and asks to speak with Sgt Darrin Crane      The Maine State Police also has an online tip form that can be accessed through

distress, his parents said He was suspected of stealing a vehicle, which was later found abandoned on a dirt road in Ashland      No one has heard from him since, and his parents, Carol, 78, and Bernard Ross Sr., 80, had to learn to live without knowing his fate      But any peace they might have found was disrupted when they received an unsigned letter a couple of months ago at their home on Munjoy Hill in Portland, police said The author indicated that he or she knew about their son’s disappearance, referenced a previous story in the Kennebec Journal about missing persons that mentioned the Ross case, and then suggested that another story about Ross should appear in the Kennebec Journal The Augusta-area newspaper is owned by MaineToday Media, which also publishes the Portland Press Herald      A police spokesman said he was not aware of any connection the Kennebec Journal might have to Ross’ disappearance Maine State Police Lt Troy Gardner of the major crimes unit in Houlton contacted the newspapers, hoping that a story might coax the letter’s author to contact police      “I’ve never had anything like this happen in my career,” Gardner said “Basically, all we’re doing is extending an olive branch, saying we want to make contact with this person Of course, there’s no way of knowing whether the letter’s truthful or the information is accurate, but we are asking for whoever wrote the letter to please contact us.”      Gardner declined to release the letter, describe what it said or explain what made police take the unusual step of contacting the newspapers to arrange for an interview with the missing man’s family Gardner acknowledged that the letter could be an elaborate hoax, but added that even if it wasn’t, police wouldn’t release it to the public      “If there was details in the letter that we felt were important to the investigation, we wouldn’t release them,” he said “That’s common sense It protects the integrity of the investigative process.”      Gardner arranged for an interview with Carol and Bernard Ross Sr on Friday The couple said they are reluctant to put themselves into the spotlight, but were willing to endure the pain of talking with reporters because they want to do what’s right for their son      The couple, who have been married for 60 years, said their other children are grown and have children of their own, but they still wonder what happened to their oldest son Perhaps the most painful memories were the calls they received from police departments around the country trying to identify a body, putting them in the macabre position of hoping the deceased person was their son      “We’ve had several calls,” Carol Ross said “You’d get your hopes up, but of course it would turn out to be someone else.”      Share

{"article_number": 3201, "article_idx": 3, "article_text": " The superintendent of the West Allegheny School District spoke to Pittsburgh’s Action News 4 Wednesday for the first time about a controversial “Kindness Workshop” that some parents said ended with students in tears      Parents outraged at workshop asking 8th graders if.. Parents in one Allegheny County school district are furious over a “kindness workshop” held at a middle school in which eighth graders were asked deeply personal questions in front of their classmates, including whether they are homosexual and if their parents have been to jail More      I think there are unintended consequences, and those consequences could have been potentially avoided had we vetted the questions, and planned the workshop with parents,” said Superintendent Dr Jerri Lippert      VIDEO: Watch the latest report from Bob Hazen      The school district held a meeting Tuesday night to address concerns after receiving several parental complaints following the Kindness Workshop -- a story Pittsburgh's Action News 4 broke last week      Prior to Tuesday's meeting, the district sent parents and the media a two-page letter defending the workshop and listing what it said were 16 facts backing up the curriculum and the decision to present it to students in the eighth grade      The letter stated that most students seemed to enjoy the workshop and that many of the parents who complained did not have students who were part of the workshop The district also stated that parents were mailed a letter in advance giving them the choice to opt out of the workshop The also said kids did not have to participate      Specifically, the letter said, The majority of student feedback indicated that the workshop was positive, thought provoking and impactful It went on to say that very few parents called the school to voice their concerns and gain a better understanding of the activities in the workshop      The meeting began with West Allegheny School Community Relations Coordinator Karen Ruhl barring the media from attending, explaining that it was a parents only meeting However, state Rep Mark Mustio was allowed inside without being a parent of an eighth-grader at the school      Mustio declined Pittsburgh's Action News 4's repeated requests for comment following the meeting      Parents who exited the meeting were mostly irate Not one parent who spoke with Pittsburgh's Action News 4 said they were satisfied with the district However, some parents did say they believed those behind the plan had good intentions but did not execute the program very well      One key issue was the opt-out letter mailed to parents The district said it provided an opportunity to avoid the workshop and that only two parents even responded However, many parents said they would have absolutely responded if the opt-out letter had better spelled out the questions their kids would be asked      “The damage they’ve done to our kids How do you fix it? How do you fix what’s already been done? All they’re doing is covering themselves, said Marie-Noelle Briggs      Briggs has a son in eighth grade at the school      “I never would expect a middle school to ask 13-year-old kids if their parent was in jail, if they’re same sex, if they're having financial issues, said Briggs      For one activity, students were asked to hold multicolored masks over their faces and to step into the middle of the circle if:      -You identify as female      -You identify as male      -You identify as Asian, East Asian, East Indian, Pacific Islander, Laotian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodian or Filipino      -You have one or more parents who did not go to college      -You or someone in your family is from another country      -You identify as Jewish or are of Jewish heritage      -You identify as African American or African descent      -You or someone close to you has been impacted by alcohol or drugs      -You or someone close to you identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender      -You or your family has ever worried about not having enough money      -You or someone close to you has been imprisoned      -You have ever heard anyone call someone a fag or say, that's so gay      Students were then prompted to answer discussion questions such as What were some of the feelings that came up for you during this activity?      “The actual questions were designed for students to have a greater understanding of, if somebody associates with being a certain religion, sexual orientation, those types of things, that if they use words, even in passing, they can actually hurt them,” Superintendent Lippert said      The district wrote that variations of the activity have been presented by the Hope Alliance, Public Allies, Youth Communities, Rockwood Middle School, the FireStarter Youth Power Curriculum and Training for Change      Part of the curriculum was created by a local non-profit based in the Southside Jessica Ruffin, the director of Public Allies Pittsburgh, said West Allegheny did not have their permission to use it but also, it's not meant for kids      Our curriculum as an AmeriCorps program, is designed to serve young adults It's an adult learning curriculum for people over the age of 18 and definitely is inappropriate for middle school students, Ruffin said      Public Allies said they have no hard feelings toward West Allegheny school district, they just wanted to clarify they weren't a direct contributor      In a letter sent home to parents, the administration also said three other local school districts, New Brighton, South Side Area and Chartiers Valley, had used the same activity in previous years But top officials for all three districts said they have never asked students personal, probing questions during such an exercise      Lippert wouldn’t explain exactly who chose the questions, but said she is ultimately accountable for the workshop She also said parents should have been involved in choosing the questions, or at least warned more fully about what was going to be asked      “If we ever decided to do that activity again, we’d have a group of parents sit down, include the school psychologist, and have a broader vetting process,” Lippert said “Every single person in that room is committed to addressing issues of bullying And if we can find ways to work together, we’ll probably be more successful.”      Lippert said the questions and materials came from a group called Public Allies, which has an office in Pittsburgh, and all of it was age-appropriate      A group of parents and relatives of West Allegheny Middle School students have contacted an attorney to sue the school district over the workshop      Pamela Brosovic said she has a nephew in the eighth grade at the middle school      “These parents are upset Their children went home in tears, said Brosovic      Brosovic said she has contacted a lawyer and has other parents on board to sue the district      Attorney Robert Mielnicki confirmed to Pittsburgh's Action News 4 Tuesday night that he has been contacted by several parents who want to sue the district      He said the Kindness Workshop may have been a legal problem under intentional infliction of emotional distress, privacy violations or even civil rights violations      “None of them got in a circle for me I asked them to do the same thing they wanted the kids to do Stand in a circle, put a mask on and stand in the circle and say all your problems, said Brosovic      Brosovic said she asked district administrators and the board to participate in the same workshop the students were involved with      District spokeswoman Karen Ruhl told Pittsbugh's Action News 4 the district would not comment on Tuesday's meeting until its conclusion      However, at the end of the meeting, Ruhl declined multiple requests for comments and an interview Lippert was not made available either      School board president Debbie Mirich initially said she was tired and wanted to leave       Mirich then read from a printed statement, which had been emailed to Pittsburgh's Action News 4:      We are very pleased with the turnout this evening and we greatly appreciate any opportunity to engage with our parents to better service students of West Allegheny we do stand behind the intentions of the workshop and we look forward to continuing are (sic) work with parents to address the very serious issues of bullying and the unintentional acts that continue to marginalize different groups of students  We stand behind Dr Lippert and our administrative staff they have full bored (sic) support      Mirich then declined WTAE's repeated requests for an interview to ask questions about what transpired during the meeting      Is this abnormal for reporters to try to ask questions? asked Pittsburgh's Action News 4 reporter Beau Berman      Yes, because our school district's never been put in a bad light like this, said Mirich      Are we putting you in a bad light? It's the parents who are upset, said Berman      Yeah, it's the parents, but it's just been a long week, said Mirich      Mirich only began to answer questions after she became accidentally locked inside the middle school lobby along with Ruhl      “We’ve just done it (the Kindness Workshop) this year with this eighth-grade class and no, we have no intentions of continuing this, said Mirich      Mirich said she was not certain how many board members were in attendance at the meeting Tuesday, saying, We did not sit together      None of the board members contacted for comment by Pittsburgh's Action News 4 via email responded, except for Mirich      When asked why district administrators were not commenting after the meeting, Ruhl repeatedly referenced the upcoming board meeting on Wednesday      You're more than welcome to come to the board meeting tomorrow, said Ruhl      Mirich said the district is going to form committees with parents to address some of these issues here      She said the district did not vote on the Kindness Workshop prior to implementation      We put our faith in our administrative staff and our superintendent, said Mirich      Some parents, such as Brosovic, have called for the superintendent to lose her job      Danielle Bear, a parent, said she has a student in sixth grade and seventh grade at the middle school      “They said they don’t want to come to school here for eighth grade, said Bear      “I think it’s a horrible idea It’s putting kids on the spot for things that parents are working through or maybe they don’t want them to know about, Bear added      On social media, some questioned whether the workshop could lead students to feel pressured to reveal their sexuality or sexual preference      “All they did was give the bullies more ammunition, said Briggs      A school board meeting is scheduled for Wednesday night      Pittsburgh's Action News 4 reporter Beau Berman will be at the meeting Follow his Twitter (@BeauWTAE) for updates Watch his report tonight at 11 p.m ", "summary": "– A community in suburban Pittsburgh is grappling with the loss of a 12-year-old boy who committed suicide, his family says, because he was bullied Hundreds attended a prayer walk in his honor three days later, and teachers and police officers went to his funeral, but the spotlight has fallen on apparent bullying at West Allegheny Middle School Long says Evan was shoved and stabbed with pencils on the school bus, and others in his family say bullying continued throughout the day School officials admit they need a better anti-bullying policy, but an optional \"Kindness Workshop\" for eighth-graders in January triggered a backlash when it left some students in tears, WTAE reported at the time The workshop had students cover their faces with multicolored masks and answer personal questions by standing in a circle;

It feels like they’re just stonewalling.”      Treating a stroke victim without access to imaging technology is difficult, said Dr Walter J Koroshetz, deputy director at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, because it is impossible to be sure what kind of stroke occurred “If it’s a blockage of the blood vessel, the damage is done,” he said But if the problem is a hemorrhaging vessel, more damage could still occur, “because that blood vessel is feeding brain that’s undamaged yet.”      The most famous instance of a person being airlifted from the South Pole for medical reasons was that involving Jerri Nielsen FitzGerald, a doctor who treated herself for breast cancer for months while stationed at the American research station When she departed, on Oct 16, 1999, it was the earliest in the Antarctic spring that a plane had taken off, according to The Antarctic Sun, a newspaper put out by the United States Antarctic Program, which is run by the National Science Foundation She died in 2009 of a recurrence of breast cancer      Temperatures must be higher than minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit for most planes to land at Amundsen-Scott or the fuel will turn to jelly While that threshold has been crossed at the South Pole recently, the temperature still regularly dips to 70 degrees below zero      “A risky rescue flight might not only jeopardize the health and safety of the patient but that of the flight crew and personnel on the ground at South Pole as well,” said Deborah Wing, a spokeswoman for the National Science Foundation      Ms Douceur and Raytheon are also tussling over whether a medical attendant should be on the Oct 17 flight She says she is worried about the effects of flying on her already oxygen-deprived brain and wants a medical professional on board Raytheon has offered to send an unspecified “attendant,” she said The company declined to comment      Flying into Amundsen-Scott during the Antarctic winter, which runs from mid-February until late October, is indeed dangerous, said Col Ronnie Smith, a former Air Force navigator who has flown there about 300 times      “It’s like no other airfield in the U.S.,” Colonel Smith said A pilot landing a plane there in winter, when it is dark 24 hours a day, would be flying blind “because you can’t install lights under the ice,” he said      “You need low wind conditions, because even a 15-mile-per-hour wind will blow the loose snow around 100 or 200 feet up in the air,” Colonel Smith said ", "summary": "– A compelling story out of the US South Pole station: Manager Renee-Nicole Douceur says she has suffered a stroke and needs to be evacuated for proper treatment, but the National Science Foundation says it won't be safe enough to send in a plane for at least a few more weeks The push includes a website and a Facebook page, and Douceur has given interviews to Discovery and the New York Times among other media outlets I'm saying to myself why isn't there a plane here to get me out of here today or even yesterday?\" Raytheon spokesman: “During the winter period, extremely cold temperatures and high winds make an extraction dangerous for all involved, passengers as well as crew, and such an extraction is considered only in life-threatening conditions.” Douceur's niece: “My question back to them is, By what standard is a stroke considered a nonemergency?”", "summary_all": "– A compelling story out of the US South Pole station: Manager Renee-Nicole Douceur says she has suffered a stroke and needs to be evacuated for proper treatment, but the National Science Foundation says it won't be safe enough to send in a plane for at least a few more weeks The 58-year-old Douceur and her family are now making a public push to pressure the NSF and the company that manages the base, Raytheon Polar Services, to move The push includes a website and a Facebook page, and Douceur has given interviews to Discovery and the New York Times among other media outlets A few quotes tell the tale: Douceur: \"I'm just hanging in there and I'm looking out my window and it's nice and clear bright and sunny I'm saying to myself why isn't there a plane here to get me out of here today or even yesterday?\" Raytheon spokesman: “During the winter period, extremely cold temperatures and high winds make an extraction dangerous for all involved, passengers as well as crew, and such an extraction is considered only in life-threatening conditions.” Douceur's niece: “My question back to them is, By what standard is a stroke considered a nonemergency?”"}

ABC News has learned that investigators have seized computers belonging to Adam Lanza from the home he shared with his mother Three weapons were found at the school scene and a fourth was recovered from Lanza's car Lanza had hundreds of rounds and used multiple high-capacity magazines when he went on the rampage, according to Connecticut State Police      Vance said that every single electronic device, weapon and round will be thoroughly examined and investigated as well as every aspect of Lanza's life going back to the date of birth      ABC News has learned that both the shooter and his mother spent time at an area gun range; however it was not yet known whether they had shot there      President Obama delivered an emotional address at an interfaith prayer vigil in Newtown on Sunday night, comforting the community      I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation, the president said I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow nor can they heal your wounded hearts I can only hope it helps to know you are not alone .. and that all across this land we have wept with you      These tragedies must end, Obama said And to end them we must change      Thousands came out of the prayer vigil where Red Cross members distributed stuffed dogs to children and adults wept in the auditorium      We needed this We needed to be together, here in this room, in the gymnasium, outside the doors of this school, in living rooms around the world, said Rev Matt Crebbin, senior minister of the Newtown Congregational Church These darkest days of our community shall not be the final word heard from us ", "summary": "– A computer found at Adam Lanza's home had been smashed and the hard drive damaged with a hammer or screwdriver, and investigators now say they have been unable to recover data from it that could shed light on the motive for the Connecticut school shooting, reports the New York Times The computer was among large amounts of evidence seized from the home Lanza shared with his mother as part of a painstaking investigation that is expected to take months, ABC reports", "summary_all": "– A computer found at Adam Lanza's home had been smashed and the hard drive damaged with a hammer or screwdriver, and investigators now say they have been unable to recover data from it that could shed light on the motive for the Connecticut school shooting, reports the New York Times The computer was among large amounts of evidence seized from the home Lanza shared with his mother as part of a painstaking investigation that is expected to take months, ABC reports Experts had earlier told ComputerWorld that the recovery effort would depend on whether Lanza knew enough to break, scratch, or puncture the drive platters \"If the drive's platters aren't smashed they can put them into another drive and read them,\" the CEO of forensics data recovery firm Kessler International says \"But if he broke the platters, the likelihood of data recovery is slim to none.\" \"It looked like he took steps to damage it—he smashed it,\" confirmed an official to the Times."}
{"article_number": 49, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " Investigators have not managed to retrieve any data from a computer they took from the house where the gunman in the Newtown, Conn., school shootings lived with his mother because he had all but destroyed the hard drive, a senior law enforcement official said Monday      “It looked like he took steps to damage it — he smashed it,” said the official, adding that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had joined the State Police in an unsuccessful effort to recover data that might lead to some understanding of what might have prompted the gunman, Adam Lanza, 20, to go on a rampage      He began at his own house, shooting his mother, Nancy Lanza, with one of the five weapons that were registered to her there, and then moved to Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, where he killed 20 first graders and 6 school employees with a semiautomatic assault rifle Some were hit 11 times      But the official said it did not appear that Mr Lanza had left any letters or notes that would offer a motive for the killings, or explain why he had targeted the school      As investigators continued to examine other evidence they had seized, the first funerals were held on a gloomy and chaotic day that brought word of a second survivor, a school employee who was wounded but had not been mentioned in earlier accounts of the carnage Her name was not immediately released The other survivor at Sandy Hook was identified as the school’s lead teacher, Natalie Hammond, 40      The spokesman for the State Police, Lt J Paul Vance, said investigators would “examine everything and anything,” including cellphones, game consoles and “anything that can provide us with information” about Mr Lanza and his motivations for the rampage      Photo      But he provided no indication as to why Mr Lanza had trained such firepower on the students in two classrooms at the school Lieutenant Vance said Mr Lanza had “no connection” to the school      Mr Lanza, 20, lived with his mother in a house about five miles away She owned the guns he fired and the car he drove to the school Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have determined that Mr Lanza and his mother had visited firing ranges, sometimes together, sometimes separately, according to a federal law enforcement official The agents have been interviewing firearm dealers in Connecticut to “get a clear picture of what activities took place” before the shooting, said the official, who would not identify the shooting ranges      Monday brought a new and grim reality to schools across the country In some places, armed officers greeted students amid tighter safety procedures, and education officials rethought their security policies There was a large police presence outside a funeral home in Newtown after what Lt James Perez of the Fairfield Police Department described as vague threats of protests and “stupid comments” on the Internet and on social media      In Ridgefield, Conn., a half-hour’s drive from Newtown, the police received a call about a “suspicious” stranger dressed in black and carrying what appeared to be a rifle He was said to be walking from a train station toward an elementary school before the school day had even begun      Officials ordered a lockdown — effectively a lockout, since most of the students were on school buses that had not arrived yet The buses were diverted to another school while the police searched the area The students were let into the school about four hours later, and the police eventually arrested a suspect, Wilfredo M Seda, 22, of Redding, Conn He had an umbrella that “had the outward appearance of a Samurai sword,” the Ridgefield police said in a statement He was charged with a breach of the peace      In Newtown, classes were canceled on Monday, and it was not clear whether students would ever attend classes in the Sandy Hook building again Gov Dannel P Malloy approved an arrangement for the students to use a surplus school building a few miles away, in Monroe, and the children’s desks from Sandy Hook were moved there      Mr Malloy held an emotional news conference in Hartford during which he described his decision to tell the last, desperate parents at the firehouse in Newtown on Friday that none of their loved ones had survived the massacre Struggling to keep his composure, the governor said that it had become clear there was no protocol that could be followed, and that rather than relying on the traditional routine of having relatives identify a body, he felt the best thing to do was simply to tell them there was no hope      Photo      “I made the decision that to have that go on any longer was wrong,” he said      Mr Lanza’s mother had divorced his father, Peter J Lanza, in 2008, citing “irreconcilable differences” after 27 years of marriage The couple had joint custody of Adam Lanza, but he was expected to “reside primarily with the mother,” according to divorce settlement papers filed in Stamford Superior Court      The settlement was generous to Ms Lanza and her sons — Adam had an older brother, Ryan She got the family house, and Mr Lanza was to provide $240,000 a year in alimony starting in 2010 The amount was to increase annually through 2015, when it was to reach $298,800      Newsletter Sign Up

while the settlement said Peter Lanza was responsible for paying the two sons’ college tuition and for providing “a car for their son Adam” — if Adam wanted one, and if Ms Lanza paid for the insurance — Ms Lanza was responsible for unreimbursed medical expenses Those, the settlement said, included “hospital, optical, psychiatric, psychological and nursing expenses.”      A mediator who worked with the couple told The Associated Press that they told her that Adam Lanza had received a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome      Some details about Adam Lanza’s teenage years also emerged Around the time the divorce was in the works, he attended Western Connecticut State University as a part-time student He did not make much of an impression      Prof Renate Ludanyi, the director of the university’s German studies center, said that Mr Lanza was a student in her class during spring 2009, according to her grade books But she said her memories of him were faint “If at all I remember a quiet kid, a quiet young man sitting by the door,” she said      Mr Lanza dropped out of the class before the final grades were compiled His grades until then had been “medium to not very good,” she said ",

{"article_number": 3154, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "President Obama charted a middle course Wednesday for ending the U.S military involvement in Afghanistan, outlining a departure plan that will remove troops faster than his commanders had requested but more slowly than many of his political allies would like      In a prime-time address from the White House, Obama said he will bring home 10,000 U.S troops by the end of the year and 23,000 more by next summer, a withdrawal window that will conclude two months before voters decide whether to give him a second term The first troops will leave Afghanistan next month      “Tonight,” the president said from the East Room, “we take comfort in knowing that the tide of war is receding.”      In contrast to his 2009 decision to send additional forces to Afghanistan, Obama appeared to give greater weight this time to the growing impatience of a war-weary public and a skeptical Congress, whose members have been demanding a rapid drawdown and a narrower mission after nearly a decade of battle      Obama was a relatively new commander in chief when he authorized the troop “surge” 18 months ago Today he is a candidate for reelection at the head of a party deeply opposed to the war, and he emphasized his push to end the U.S military presence in Afghanistan and Iraq to “reclaim the American dream that is at the center of our story.”      “Over the last decade, we have spent $1 trillion on war, at a time of rising debt and hard economic times,” he said in a 13-minute address that sounded at times like a campaign speech “America, it is time to focus on nation-building here at home.”      Obama’s decision drew a measured response from Capitol Hill, where some Democrats indicated that they will continue to pressure the president for a faster withdrawal      In a statement, Sen Carl M Levin (D-Mich.), the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, called the plan a “positive development, although in my view the conditions on the ground justify an even larger drawdown of U.S troops.”      Sen John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in a statement that he is “concerned that the withdrawal plan that President Obama announced tonight poses an unnecessary risk to the hard-won gains that our troops have made thus far in Afghanistan and to the decisive progress that must still be made.”      He added: “This is not the ‘modest’ withdrawal that I and others had hoped for and advocated.”      Obama’s plan will also influence U.S allies in Afghanistan, which supply about 40,000 troops — about 30 percent of the international forces there Some European leaders are as eager as Obama to end their expensive and politically unpopular commitments to the Afghanistan war effort, and they welcomed the president’s announcement      On Thursday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said France will pull its 4,000 troops out of Afghanistan on the same staggered timetable as the U.S withdrawal German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said his country wants to reduce the German contingent of 4,900 troops by the end of 2011--but has not yet formulated a withdrawal plan      Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who along with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and European leaders was briefed by Obama in advance of the speech, also cheered Obama’s announcement, saying “today is a very happy day” for Afghanistan      “We thank the international communities for their help and services to our country, and Afghanistan will always be thankful to them,” Karzai told reporters      But the Taliban said it considered Obama’s drawdown plan “only as a symbolic step which will never satisfy the war-weary international community or the American people.”      Obama’s plan covers the withdrawal of the 33,000 troops that he ordered to Afghanistan at the end of 2009, when he also set July 2011 as the date they would begin coming home      That decision, largely consistent with the request of his military commanders, followed a months-long strategy review designed to correct the downward course of a conflict that Obama as a candidate called “the war we need to win.”      The pullout schedule he outlined Wednesday will leave 68,000 U.S troops in Afghanistan by the end of next summer, and Obama said their departure will continue steadily through 2014, when the Afghan army is scheduled to take over security      Obama’s military commanders had requested that the bulk of the surge forces remain in Afghanistan through the end of next year, giving them another full fighting season at nearly current strength in addition to the one underway      In the past week, the president met three times with his national security team, sessions that included Gen David H Petraeus, the commander of international forces in Afghanistan, whom he has nominated to head the CIA      Petraeus presented Obama with a range of withdrawal proposals — some, administration officials acknowledged, that would keep the surge forces in Afghanistan far longer than Obama had envisioned But the adopted plan, those officials said, has the military’s support      “The president’s decision was fully within the range of options presented to him,” said one senior administration official, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the plan      Military officers had sought the additional time with the surge forces to consolidate battlefield gains that remain, in their assessment, “fragile and reversible.”      They also argued that maintaining pressure on the battlefield would benefit U.S efforts to broker a reconciliation between Karzai, an unpredictable ally, and the Taliban, which the administration has determined cannot be eliminated as a political force      But administration officials said Wednesday that the surge has already done its job by bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table      “Thanks to the pressure delivered by the surge, we’re in active support of Afghan initiatives to reach out to the Taliban and explore what might be possible by way of a political settlement,” said a second administration official “And there are openings today that simply didn’t exist 18 months ago.”      In the weeks preceding his decision, Obama confronted mounting criticism of maintaining a large U.S presence in Afghanistan at a time of economic distress and fiscal constraint at home            Administration officials said Vice President Biden, who led a faction of civilian advisers who argued against a large troop surge in 2009, is pleased with Obama’s withdrawal schedule, even though it is not as quick as Biden had hoped it would be      Biden and other senior White House officials, including national security adviser Thomas E Donilon, had pushed for a significantly larger number of the surge forces to return by the end of this year      The war effort costs the United States about $10 billion a month — a figure some congressional leaders have called “unsustainable” — and a majority of Americans no longer think the battle is worth fighting Since the surge began, 684 U.S troops have been killed in Afghanistan      Even congressional Republicans, long the bedrock of support for Obama’s war policy, have called for a faster drawdown and a sharper focus on destroying al-Qaeda rather than rebuilding Afghanistan      Obama’s own party long ago turned against the mission More recently, some leading Democratic foreign policy figures, as well administration allies, have called for a new approach to take advantage of recent changes on the ground      Those include the killing in May of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, a sanctuary for al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders, where many war skeptics believe the real enemy resides      “We haven’t seen a terrorist threat emanating from Afghanistan for the past seven or eight years,” said a third senior administration official, describing the reasoning behind the withdrawal “The threat has come from Pakistan over the past half-dozen years or so, and longer.”      Special correspondents Sayed Salahuddin and Javed Hamdard in Kabul and staff writer Felicia Sonmez and staff researcher Julie Tate in Washington

decade-long commitment, he talked of “ending the war responsibly” and warned of the perils of overextending the military by sending large numbers of soldiers into combat He acknowledged that huge challenges remained before an end to the conflict that has cost hundreds of billions of dollars and 1,500 American lives      The withdrawals would begin winding down the military’s counterinsurgency strategy, which Mr Obama adopted 18 months ago Administration officials indicated that they now planned to place more emphasis on focused clandestine counterterrorism operations of the kind that killed Osama bin Laden , which the president cited as Exhibit A in the case for a substantial American troop reduction      Photo      “We are starting this drawdown from a position of strength,” Mr Obama said “ Al Qaeda is under more pressure than at any time since 9/11.” He said that an intense campaign of drone strikes and other covert operations in Pakistan had crippled Al Qaeda’s original network in the region, leaving its leaders either dead or pinned down in the rugged border between Pakistan and Afghanistan Of 30 top Qaeda leaders identified by American intelligence, 20 have been killed in the last year and a half, administration officials said      But the withdrawal of the entire surge force by the end of next summer will significantly change the way that the United States

said      General Petraeus had recommended limiting withdrawals to 5,000 troops this year and another 5,000 over the winter      He and other military commanders argued that the 18 months since Mr

areas in the east, along the Pakistan border, will be curtailed or even canceled, officials said      The effort to transfer responsibility for security to Afghan forces remains elusive because the Afghan troops are proving unprepared for the job Corruption in the government of President Hamid Karzai continues to be rampant, sapping the confidence of many Afghans      Still, the growing disenchantment in the United States with the war, particularly given the ballooning national debt , the country’s slow economic recovery and the whopping $120 billion price tag of the Afghan conflict this year alone, were all considerations weighed by the president “Over the last decade, we have spent a trillion dollars on war at a time of rising debt and hard economic times,” Mr Obama said “Now, we must invest in America’s greatest resource: our people.”      Republican presidential candidates including Mitt Romney and Jon M Huntsman Jr are demanding a swift withdrawal from Afghanistan, while

NATO commander in Afghanistan Obama informed his senior national security advisers, including outgoing Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, of his plans during a White House meeting Tuesday      The president is commander in chief, spokesman Jay Carney said He is in charge of this process, and he makes the decision      The administration has begun briefing NATO allies on its plans British Prime Minister David Cameron's office confirmed that officials there have been informed but declined to offer comment, or to make any immediate statement on the plans for about 9,500 British forces in Afghanistan      The withdrawals would put the U.S on a path toward giving Afghans control of their security by 2014 and ultimately shifting the U.S military from a combat role to a mission focused on training and supporting Afghan forces      The Obama administration has said its goal in continuing the Afghanistan war is to blunt the Taliban insurgency and dismantle and defeat al-Qaida, the terror network that used the country as a training ground for the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S As of Tuesday, at least 1,522 members of the U.S military had died in Afghanistan as a result of the U.S invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001, according to an Associated Press count      The U.S and its allies have set Dec 31, 2014, as a target date for ending the combat mission in Afghanistan      A reduction this year totaling 10,000 troops would be the rough equivalent of two brigades, which are the main building blocks of an Army division It's not clear whether Obama's decision would require the Pentagon to pull out two full brigades or, instead, withdraw a collection of smaller combat and support units with an equivalent number of troops      If Obama were to leave the bulk of the 30,000 surge contingent in Afghanistan through 2012, he would be giving the military another fighting season _ in addition to the one now under way _ to further damage Taliban forces before a larger withdrawal got started It also would buy more time for the Afghan army and police to grow in numbers and capability      Under that scenario, the emphasis in U.S.-led military operations is likely to shift away from troop-intensive counterinsurgency operations toward more narrowly focused counterterrorism operations, which focus on capturing and killing insurgents      Afghan security forces and judicial institutions are expected to take up many aspects of the counterinsurgency fight by establishing the rule of law and respect for government institutions, U.S officials in Afghanistan said Tuesday      In recent speeches, Afghan President Hamid Karzai has criticized American forces, suggesting his ally is in danger of becoming an occupying force He has even threatened action against international forces that conduct airstrikes and has accused allies of undermining and corrupting his government      Yet there are concerns in his country about the withdrawals Some of the areas slated to transition to Afghan control have been struck by attacks in recent weeks despite assertions by Karzai that peace talks have started between the U.S., his Afghan government and Taliban emissaries Publicly, the Taliban say there will be no negotiations until foreign troops leave Afghanistan      The transition to full Afghan control will begin in earnest on July 20 in five provincial capital cities and two provinces The provincial capitals identified for transition are Lashkar Gah in Helmand province, plus capitals from provinces in the west, east and north and most of Kabul, the nation's capital The largely peaceful northern provinces of Bamyan and Panjshir will also start to transition to Afghan control      Some U.S military commanders have favored a more gradual reduction in troops than Obama is expected to announce Wednesday night, arguing that too fast a withdrawal could undermine the fragile security gains      But other advisers have backed a more significant withdrawal that starts in July and proceeds steadily through the following months That camp believes the slow yet steady improvements in security, combined with the killing of Osama bin Laden and U.S success in dismantling much of the al-Qaida network in the country, give the president an opportunity to make larger reductions this year      Obama previously has said he favors a significant withdrawal beginning in July, his self-imposed deadline for starting to bring U.S troops home Aides, however, have never quantified that statement      Pressure for a substantial withdrawal has been mounting from the public and Congress Even Gates, who has said he favored a modest withdrawal, said Tuesday that Obama's decision needed to incorporate domestic concerns about the war      It goes without saying that there are a lot of reservations in the Congress about the war in Afghanistan and our level of commitment, Gates said during a news conference at the State Department There are concerns among the American people who are tired of a decade of war      According to an Associated Press-GfK poll last month, 80 percent of Americans say they approve of Obama's decision to begin withdrawal of combat troops in July and end U.S combat operations in Afghanistan by 2014 Just 15 percent disapprove      On Capitol Hill, even the more moderate or conservative members of his party, such as Sen Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Sen Joe Manchin of West Virginia, are pressing for significant cuts and a shift in mission      The question the president faces _ we all face _ is quite simple: Will we choose to rebuild America or Afghanistan? In light of our nation's fiscal peril, we cannot do both, Manchin said Tuesday      Sen Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said improved conditions in Afghanistan would permit Obama to withdraw at least 15,000 troops by the end of the year      Obama aides have sidestepped questions about what role the cost of the war in Afghanistan played in Obama's decision, saying only that the president was focused on meeting the goal of transferring security by 2014      Following the announcement on the drawdown, Obama will visit troops Thursday at Fort Drum, the upstate New York Army post that is home to the 10th Mountain Division, one of the most frequently deployed divisions to Afghanistan      ___      Associated Press writers Lolita C Baldor, Matthew Lee and Donna Cassata in Washington and Solomon Moore in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report      ___      Robert Burns can be reached at http://twitter.com/roburtburnsAP Julie Pace can be reached at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC ", "summary": "– A few hours ahead of President Obama's prime-time address on Afghanistan, administration officials are leaking some main points to the AP, Washington Post, and the New York Times: Obama will bring home 10,000 troops this year and another 20,000 or so by the end of next summer Another 70,000 US troops would remain in the country heading into 2013", "summary_all": "– A few hours ahead of President Obama's prime-time address on Afghanistan, administration officials are leaking some main points to the AP, Washington Post, and the New York Times: Obama will bring home 10,000 troops this year and another 20,000 or so by the end of next summer Those combined withdrawals will effectively mean the return home of all the \"surge\" troops Obama sent to Afghanistan in 2009 Another 70,000 US troops would remain in the country heading into 2013 The timeline does not please Gen David Petraeus, who wants the surge troops to remain through the end of 2012—long enough for another season of fighting (The Times says Petraeus did not endorse the decision, though Robert Gates and Hillary Clinton did with reluctance.)

{"article_number": 5330, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " “The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.” – George Orwell, Animal Farm      “Leck bei Wikileaks“ The headline in German-language news weekly, Der Freitag, described the irony with Teutonic efficiency: “Leak at Wikileaks“      In the story, published on Friday, editor Steffen Kraft claims to have found online a “password protected csv file” containing a 1.73GB cache of entirely unredacted diplomatic cables, originating from Wikileaks According to Kraft, the password for the file is also easy to locate      The same day, Wikileaks dumped a large number of cables online and asked its followers to help sift through them Copies of the files have been in the possession of news organizations like the Guardian, the New York Times and Reuters for months, but this is the first time the documents had been made available to the public The release came, says chief leaker Julian Assange, because the media has lost interest in the diplomatic revelations as yet unreported (A cynic might infer that Assange — who remains under house arrest in the UK pending extradition on sexual assault charges — is worried that the media has lost interest in him too.)      But the document found by Der Freitag are not the official Wikileaks files, which have been partly redacted to remove the names of vulnerable sources Rather it contained thousands of unredacted pages, with ‘named or otherwise identifiable “informers” and “suspected intelligence agents,” from Israel, Jordan, Iran and Afghanistan.’      It’s important to emphasize that Der Freitag hasn’t published hard proof that the unredacted file even exists But according to Kraft, the found documents include many that have previously been published in censored form And, to be clear, Der Freitag is not just some rogue German paper: they have a syndication deal with the Guardian (an erst-while Wikileaks partner) making it highly unlikely they’d invent the story out of whole cloth (Update: Der Spiegel has confirmed the existence of the file — see below for more.)      So, if the unreadacted files have found their way available online, what are we to make of it? Kraft makes a clear implication that the files might have been leaked by Assanage’s arch-nemesis (and former colleague), Daniel Domscheit-Berg of OpenLeaks Earlier this week he claimed to have destroyed thousands of unpublished documents before leaving Wikileaks and he’s made no secret of his hatred of his old pal (I’ve written previously about his scummy anti-Assange memoir) Certainly, along with staffers at the Guardian, the New York Times and any of Wikileaks’ growing number of current and former mainstream media partners, Domscheit-Berg is a possible suspect      In truth, it almost doesn’t matter who is responsible: the eventual release of the unredacted cables was inevitable The message of Wikileaks — and the amoral cult of leaking for lulz that came in its wake — has always been one of callous contempt for the human cost of “free information” From Assange’s well-publicised remarks to Guardian reporters that “if [informants] get killed, they’ve got it coming to them They deserve it.”, to LulSec and Anonymous’ willingness to publish the personal details of anyone even tangentially associated with their ‘enemies’, what we see time and time again from mass-leakers is a sociopath’s disregard for individuals, combined with a Hollywood serial killer’s hunger for attention Sooner of later — for attention, to make some misguided political point, for the lulz — someone was bound to obtain and leak the raw documents      As public attention shifted from Wikileaks to Libya or Hurricane Irene or Lady Gaga appearing in the Simpsons, so the leakers must resort to riskier and riskier behavior to get back in the headlines And so it will be depressingly unsurprising if either side of the Wikileaks-Openleaks skirmish turns out to have gladly sacrificed the odd Afghan tribesman or Iranian civil servant in order to score a cheap point over their rival      [Update: Der Spiegel, another former Wikileaks partner, has confirmed that the leak is legitimate, pinning the blame squarely on the rift between Assange and Domscheit-Berg.]      Der Freitag’s headline notwithstanding, there is an even more chilling irony in all of this; and to see it, you have to turn back to the beginning of the Wikileaks story In 2010 Julian Assange invited the Guardian’s David Leigh to his hotel room to watch a video of an American helicopter allegedly mowing down a Reuter’s journalist The name of the file was ‘Collateral Murder’, and the public’s outrage at seeing American troops’ apparent disregard for innocent life made Wikileaks — and Assange — a household name If Der Freitag’s report is accurate, the words “Wikileaks” and “Collateral Murder” might be about to make a reappearance in the headlines Only this time it won’t be the American military with blood on their hands, but the leakers themselves ", "summary": "The leak was first reported in the German newsweekly Der Freitag, according to TechCrunch When he returned a number of the files later that year, some WikiLeaks supporters dumped the data online—unaware that the file was tucked among the others Now, Domscheit-Berg’s rival group, OpenLeaks, is drawing attention to the lapse, to bolster its argument that WikiLeaks data isn’t secure.", "summary_all": "– A file containing all of WikiLeaks’ 251,000 US State Department cables has—wait for it—leaked online, this time without the names of US sources redacted, meaning many of them could be in danger The file leaked out thanks to some misunderstandings, some carelessness, and the feud between Julian Assange and former spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg, Der Spiegel reports The leak was first reported in the German newsweekly Der Freitag, according to TechCrunch When Domscheit-Berg left WikiLeaks in September 2010, he took the server containing the encrypted file of the original cables with him When he returned a number of the files later that year, some WikiLeaks supporters dumped the data online—unaware that the file was tucked among the others Even then it was still encrypted and hidden—until this spring, when an Assange contact revealed the password publicly, unaware it would allow access to the cables Now, Domscheit-Berg’s rival group, OpenLeaks, is drawing attention to the lapse, to bolster its argument that WikiLeaks data isn’t secure."}

(Associated Press) FILE - In this March 24, 2017, file photo, Rep Trent Franks, R-Ariz speaks with a reporter on Capitol Hill in Washington Franks says he is resigning Jan 31 amid a House Ethics Committee investigation.. (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — A former aide to Republican Rep Trent Franks has told The Associated Press the congressman repeatedly pressed her to carry his child, at one point offering her $5 million to act as a surrogate mother      The eight-term lawmaker abruptly resigned Friday, bowing to an ultimatum from House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis Ryan told Franks that he would refer the allegations to the Ethics Committee and urged him to step aside      The former staffer said the congressman at least four times asked if she'd be willing to act as a surrogate in exchange for money Franks, in his statement announcing his resignation, said he and his wife, who have struggled with infertility, have twins who were carried through surrogacy      The former aide said the conversations took place in private, sometimes in the congressman's car, and that she repeatedly told him she wasn't interested She said she never filed a formal complaint because until recently she didn't know where to go, but that his behavior had made her feel uncomfortable      The Associated Press verified the identity of the staffer and confirmed that she worked in Franks' office She asked that her name be withheld out of concern for her privacy,      During my time there, I was asked a few times to look over a 'contract' to carry his child, and if I would conceive his child, I would be given $5 million, she said, adding that she refused to look over the contract and has never seen a copy      The woman said the requests shocked her, and made her feel afraid that if she didn't agree, she would face professional consequences She said she spoke to another aide in the office, who had also been approached about surrogacy      The aide cited the surrogacy requests as a main reason for leaving the office, adding that she felt retaliated against after turning down the congressman, ignored by Franks and not given many assignments      A spokesman for Franks would not comment on whether the congressman offered aides money in exchange to act as surrogates      Franks, a staunch conservative, said in his statement Thursday that he never physically intimidated, coerced or attempted to have sexual contact with any member of his congressional staff      Franks, 60, said he had become familiar with the surrogacy process in recent years and became insensitive as to how the discussion of such an intensely personal topic might affect others      He said he regrets that his discussion of this option and process in the workplace with two female staffers made them feel uncomfortable      Ryan on Thursday said in a statement that he was briefed on the allegations last week, and found them to be serious and requiring action      Ryan said that he presented Franks with the allegations, which he did not deny, and filed them with the House Committee on Ethics      A senior congressional official said Ryan's general counsel was contacted about two weeks ago by someone with information about troubling behavior by Franks involving a former staffer Ryan's lawyer interviewed two women with similar complaints and verified them through a third party The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the deliberations      Andrea Lafferty, President of Traditional Values Coalition, said she is the one who reported Franks' conduct to the speaker's office Lafferty told AP that the former aide came to her about a year ago and told her about the surrogacy requests Lafferty said she contacted Ryan's office last month, after the staffer agreed to discuss the incident with leadership      I was approached last year about the situation, she came to me wanting some advice about how to handle this She came to me shaking and sobbing, and she shared a story that I think is horrific, a powerful man hiring young women, procuring staff, to potentially surrogate children for him, Lafferty said I accompanied (the former aide) to the meeting in the speaker's office where she said Congressman Trent Franks offered her $5 million if she conceived him a child      Franks' net worth of nearly $33 million makes him one of the wealthier members of Congress While surrogacy regulations and costs vary from state to state, services typically run in the range of the low hundreds of thousands of dollars The former aide said she never received details about payment or where the process would occur      Franks is one of three lawmakers to step aside in a week as sexual misconduct allegations rocked the Capitol      He said in a statement Friday: Last night, my wife was admitted to the hospital in Washington, D.C., due to an ongoing ailment After discussing options with my family, we came to the conclusion that the best thing for our family now would be for me to tender my previous resignation effective today, December 8th, 2017      On Thursday, liberal Sen Al Franken, D-Minn., announced his resignation after facing allegations of sexual harassment by at least eight women Franken said some of those accusations were false and that he remembered others differently than his accusers did He said he'd depart in a few weeks      On Tuesday, Rep John Conyers, D-Mich., resigned effective immediately He faced accusations from women of improper sexual behavior that he's contesting      Franks, an abortion opponent, drew a sharp response from Democrats during a 2013 House committee debate when he said, The incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low He sought to clarify the comment, saying later-term abortions linked to pregnancies caused by rape are infrequent      Franks is a strong backer of President Donald Trump, represents a district encompassing suburbs north and west of Phoenix      Before winning election to Congress, he served in the Arizona Legislature and founded the Arizona Family Research Institute, an organization associated with Dr James Dobson's Focus on the Family      ___

if 10 put the story on the front page, it was added to the “trending” bar            Beyond the list of 10 internationally trusted publications was another list of a thousand news sources that showed the editors where stories were trending;

For its part, Facebook—which has recently begun paying publishers including Buzzfeed and the New York Times to post a quota of Facebook Live videos every week—bills its relationship with the media as a mutually beneficial landlord-tenant partnership      Advertisement      But if you really want to know what Facebook thinks of journalists and their craft, all you need to do is look at what happened when the company quietly assembled some to work on its secretive “trending news” project The results aren’t pretty: According to five former members of Facebook’s trending news team—“news curators” as they’re known internally—Zuckerberg & Co take a downright dim view of the industry and its talent In interviews with Gizmodo, these former curators described grueling work conditions, humiliating treatment, and a secretive, imperious culture in which they were treated as disposable outsiders After doing a tour in Facebook’s news trenches, almost all of them came to believe that they were there not to work, but to serve as training modules for Facebook’s algorithm      Advertisement      Launched in January 2014, Facebook’s trending news section occupies some of the most precious real estate in all of the internet, filling the top-right hand corner of the site with a list of topics people are talking about and links out to different news articles about them The dozen or so journalists paid to run that section are contractors who work out of the basement of the company’s New York office            “We were housed in a conference room for two-and-a-half months,” said one former curator (all former curators insisted on anonymity out of concerns over violating their non-disclosure agreements with Facebook) “It was clear that Zuckerberg could squash the project at any moment.”      “It was degrading as a human being,” said another “We weren’t treated as individuals We were treated in this robot way.”      Advertisement      This section, no doubt, drives a substantial number of monthly views to news outlets Facebook wouldn’t specify, but anecdotal evidence suggests that being featured in the trending widget boosts clicks to a story by many thousands The trending news section is responsible for dictating many of the stories the average person reads when they’re using Facebook But nobody really knows much about how it works—and the company isn’t telling            “We choose what’s trending,” said one former news curator      The trending news section is run by people in their 20s and early 30s, most of whom graduated from Ivy League and private East Coast schools like Columbia University and NYU They’ve previously worked at outlets like the New York Daily News, Bloomberg, MSNBC, and the Guardian Some former curators have left Facebook for jobs at organizations including the New Yorker, Mashable, and Sky Sports      Advertisement      According to former team members interviewed by Gizmodo, this small group has the power to choose what stories make it onto the trending bar and, more importantly, what news sites each topic links out to “We choose what’s trending,” said one “There was no real standard for measuring what qualified as news and what didn’t It was up to the news curator to decide.”      News curators aren’t Facebook employees—they’re contractors One former team member said they received benefits including limited medical insurance, paid time off after 6 months and transit reimbursement, but were otherwise excluded from the culture and perks of working at Facebook “A company happy hour would happen at 8 p.m., and we’d be working,” said another former curator “We were apart from a lot of the things happening But we were employed under very different circumstances.”      When the curators, hired by companies like BCForward and Pro Unlimited (which are then subcontracted through Accenture to provide workers for Facebook), arrive at work each day, they read through a list of trending topics ranked by Facebook’s algorithm from most popular (or most engaged) to least The curators then determine the news story the terms are related to      Advertisement      The news curation team writes headlines for each of the topics, along with a three-sentence summary of the news story it’s pegged to, and choose an image or Facebook video to attach to the topic The news curator also chooses the “most substantive post” to summarize the topic, usually from a news website The former contractors Gizmodo interviewed said they were asked to write neutral headlines, and encouraged to promote a video only if it had been uploaded to Facebook They were also told to select articles from a list of preferred media outlets that included sites like the New York Times, Time, Variety, and other traditional outlets They would regularly avoid sites like World Star Hip Hop, The Blaze, and Breitbart, but were never explicitly told to suppress those outlets They were also discouraged from mentioning Twitter by name in headlines and summaries, and instead asked to refer to social media in a broader context      News curators also have the power to “deactivate” (or blacklist) a trending topic—a power that those we spoke to exercised on a daily basis A topic was often blacklisted if it didn’t have at least three traditional news sources covering it, but otherwise the protocol was murky—meaning a curator could ostensibly blacklist a topic without a particularly good reason for doing so (Those we interviewed said they didn’t see any signs that blacklisting was being abused or used inappropriately.)      In early 2015, when Facebook’s trending news project was still in its infancy, there weren’t many rules about how curators did the rest of their job “It was all pretty easy breezy,” said one “We were trained on the basics of everything, then we were thrown into the deep end” with some supervision            Advertisement      Over time, the work became increasingly demanding, and Facebook’s trending news team started to look more and more like the worst stereotypes of a digital media content farm Managers gave curators aggressive quotas for how many summaries and headlines to write, and timed how long it took curators to write a post The general standard was 20 posts a day “We shared documents to see how fast everyone was working,” said one former curator “They tried to foster inter-office competition to see how many topics we could complete every day.”      Burnout was rampant “Most of the original team isn’t there anymore,” said another former news curator “It was a stop-gap for them Most of the people were straight out of [journalism school] At least one of them was fired Most of them quit or were hired by other news outlets.”      According to one contractor, a colleague sent around a letter asking if people were unhappy with their working conditions Managers told contractors not to mention that they worked at Facebook on their resumes or in any public profiles “I got the sense that they wanted to keep the magic about how trending topics work a secret,” said another former news curator “We had to write in the most passive tense possible That’s why you’d see headlines that appear in an alien-esque, passive language.” Despite management’s best efforts, many of the contractors are publicly listed in a simple LinkedIn search            Advertisement      One reason Facebook might want to keep the trending news operation faceless is that it wants to foster the illusion of a bias-free news ranking process—a network that sorts and selects news stories like an entirely apolitical machine After all, the company’s entire media division, which is run by Facebook’s managing editor Benjamin Wagner, depends on people’s trust in the platform as a conduit for information If an editorial team is deliberating over trending topics—just like a newspaper staff would talk about front-page news—Facebook risks losing its image as a non-partisan player in the media industry, a neutral pipeline for distributing content, rather than a selective and inherently flawed curator      That said, many former employees suspect that Facebook’s eventual goal is to replace its human curators with a robotic one The former curators Gizmodo interviewed started to feel like they were training a machine, one that would eventually take their jobs Managers began referring to a “more streamlined process” in meetings As one former contractor put it: “We felt like we were part of an experiment that, as the algorithm got better, there was a sense that at some point the humans would be replaced.”      When asked about the trending news team and its future, a Facebook spokesperson said, “We don’t comment on rumor or speculation As with all contractors, the trending review team contractors are fairly compensated and receive appropriate benefits.”      Advertisement      According to those we interviewed, their peers still at Facebook believe their jobs are being phased out From a group of about 20, Facebook has fired at least eight people this year, and according to former curators, the company has yet to replace any of them “They had hired us and promised us a job for at least a year,” said one “Within three months, six of us were fired No reason was given We were just told ‘the company is cutting back.’”      One former contractor thinks that Facebook’s end goal with its trending section is simple: “It’s an experiment,” this person said “They are just running tests to see what would increase engagement At the end of the day, engagement was the only thing they wanted.”      The data Facebook is gleaning from upwards of 1 billion users clicking through the trending news module could have a significant impact on the future of news—what we read, how, and from which sources A future that, if it’s not being determined by a group of 20-something contractors in a basement, will be determined in part by the algorithm that group trained “They have it down to a science,” said one former curator “We were truly slaves to the algorithm.” ", "summary": "", "summary_all": "– A former curator of Facebook's

When Flynn was forced to resign over contacts with Russia, Trump replaced him with another general, H.R McMaster, who has the advantage of still being in the military, meaning he can wear his uniform around the office      Military affairs is the one realm in which Trump is occasionally willing to admit some level of ignorance He has openly said the generals should go about their business without consulting him, since they know more than he does (Perhaps this is atonement for his claim on the campaign trail to “know more about ISIS than the generals do.”)      Given the president’s love of men in uniform, it wouldn’t be at all surprising to see another general take over the Homeland Security post that Kelly has now vacated, or even take the top spot at the State Department considering how things are looking with Rex Tillerson      Despite Trump’s professions of love and admiration for his generals and his claim that he’s giving the military “total authorization,” the president doesn’t always seem to care about what they have to say He ignored Mattis’ plan for fighting ISIS for months He’s widely known to be frustrated with McMaster, particularly the national security adviser’s desire to commit more troops to Afghanistan And despite his claim that he’d decided to ban transgender people from the military after consultation with “my generals,” the Pentagon had no idea the announcement was coming Mattis was apparently only informed the day before and was on vacation Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Joseph Dunford says he’s not going to implement the ban until he receives an official order ", "summary": "The president must give Kelly \"the authority to crack down on the behavior of his other aides.\" Kelly got the job as chief of staff because he and Trump are simpatico when it comes to terrorism and immigration, according to NBC News Barbara Lee calls Kelly an \"extremist\" and accuses Trump of \"militarizing the White House.\" And the Nation calls Kelly's promotion a \"disaster for immigrants.\" It looks at six policies Kelly has put in place during his time at the Department of Homeland Security that have caused fear to take hold of immigrant communities Finally, while Trump enjoys having \"my generals\" around—preferring them to wear their uniforms even if they're retired and bragging that they look like they came from \"central casting\"—he doesn't have a history of actually listening to them, Slate reports", "summary_all": "– A friend of John Kelly, President Trump's new chief of staff, says the retired general will bring order and stability to the White House “He knows how to do this: with common sense and good leadership,” the unnamed friend tells the Washington Post “He won’t suffer idiots and fools.” Kelly, who spent 45 years in the Marines and was currently serving as the head of the Department of Homeland Security, was tapped by Trump to replace Reince Priebus on Friday Kelly's friend also offered a hint of how the new chief of staff will handle the leaks that are so vexing Trump's aides: “Simply go dark and do not engage.” Here's what else you need to know about Kelly and his new role in the White House: The New York Times reports the success of Kelly—the first general to be chief of staff since the Nixon administration—will hinge on bringing Trump's staff to heel The president must give Kelly \"the authority to crack down on the behavior of his other aides.\" Kelly got the job as chief of staff because he and Trump are simpatico when it comes to terrorism and immigration, according to NBC News Kelly has said \"smugglers\" are bringing \"tens of thousands of people to our nation's doorstep.\" He's also called leaks \"darn close to treason\" and defended Jared Kushner on the Russia front CNN's John Kirby says if Trump is \"wise enough to use\" Kelly, he could \"actually come out on the far side of these first six tumultuous months looking pretty good.\" The national security analyst calls Kelly \"a marvel of organization and efficiency, of candid counsel and dogged persistence.\" While Kelly has had bipartisan support in the past, not everyone is excited about his promotion, the Hill reports Democratic Rep Barbara Lee calls Kelly an \"extremist\" and accuses Trump of \"militarizing the White House.\" And the Nation calls Kelly's promotion a \"disaster for immigrants.\" It looks at six policies Kelly has put in place during his time at the Department of Homeland Security that have caused fear to take hold of immigrant communities Finally, while Trump enjoys having \"my generals\" around—preferring them to wear their uniforms even if they're retired and bragging that they look like they came from \"central casting\"—he doesn't have a history of actually listening to them, Slate reports That's something Kelly needs to recognize as he starts his new White House gig."}

White House chief of staff (Victoria Walker,Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)      Twelve days after Donald Trump’s election victory, the president-elect asked John Kelly to meet with him at the stately Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., to discuss the roles of secretaries of State and Homeland Security      It was a small gathering Present was Reince Priebus, the Republican Party chair who later became White House chief of staff, a post that he resigned this week Also attending was Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist Kelly, like other retired generals, impressed the president-elect, enough so that soon he’ll leave his post atop the Department of Homeland Security to replace Priebus in the West Wing      That meeting last November launched what has become one of the president’s most important relationships within his beleaguered administration He likes Kelly He trusts Kelly But what remains to be seen is whether Trump will listen to him as Kelly seeks to bring order to a White House beset by chaos      [In John Kelly, Trump gets a plain-spoken disciplinarian as his chief of staff]      After it was announced that Priebus would be leaving, a friend of the Homeland Security secretary told The Washington Post that Kelly, a tough talking Bostonian who spent 45 years in the Marines, is ideally suited to confront the challenges he’ll face      “He knows how to do this: with common sense and good leadership,” said Kelly’s longtime friend, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer frank opinions “He won’t suffer idiots and fools.”      But Kelly did not gel with the previous administration, and his military career ended on a sour note in January 2016 after he repeatedly clashed with the Obama White House      Officials there had grown tired of the four-star general speaking off message — about the president’s plan to shut down the prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, about the perceived vulnerability of America’s borders, about the threat posed to American interests by any number of terrorist organizations Their relationship had become so strained that in the weeks before he retired, multiple administration officials went to the media and accused Kelly and other military leaders of endeavoring to undermine the Guantánamo closure plan      [Retired Marine generals recommended each other to Trump as Pentagon chief]      At Bedminster, Trump and Kelly discussed the general’s diplomatic experience and the security concerns about which both men remain deeply passionate      His final job in the military, as head of U.S Southern Command in Miami, gave Kelly deep insight into the criminal networks ravaging South America, Central America and the Caribbean, and their illicit trafficking pipeline — for drugs, guns and people — running north through Mexico and into the United States He has long argued that transnational organized crime is among the greatest threats to U.S national security      The Obama White House didn’t always appreciate it But Trump couldn’t agree more      As Kelly moves to the West Wing, he’ll likely move quickly to confront the “reality television show that runs on a raucous mix of drama, machismo and suspicion,” as The Post’s White House team characterized it Thursday A big piece of that will be addressing leaks and the president’s portrayal in the media      “There’s a way to handle

Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly did such an efficient job implementing Donald Trump’s anti-immigration agenda that he’s getting promoted Trump announced in a surprise tweet Friday afternoon that Kelly will replace Reince Priebus as White House chief of staff Ad Policy      “John has done a spectacular job at Homeland Security,” Trump tweeted “He has been a true star of my Administration.”      Indeed, in the last six months, Kelly has turned the DHS into one of the most productive arms of the Trump administration Kelly managed to translate much of Trump’s brazen anti-immigrant campaign rhetoric into actual policy And if the numbers are any indication, Kelly has certainly flourished Arrests since Trump took office in February increased by 40 percent over the prior year But perhaps more important than the numbers is Kelly’s impact on immigrant communities, where apprehension and fear now reign      Here’s a roundup of the key policy changes that Kelly has ushered in, in just six months on the job: Related Article Meet John Kelly, Donald Trump’s New Enabler in Chief John Nichols      1) Ending prosecutorial discretion for undocumented immigrants      In a sweeping February memo, Kelly did away with the Obama-era policy of prioritizing the deportation of those who’d been convicted of serious crimes On paper (if not always in practice), the Obama administration directed immigration agents to focus their energy on those who’d been convicted of serious crimes and to largely leave alone those who’d been convicted of no crimes In February, Kelly wrote: “Unless otherwise directed, Department personnel may initiate enforcement actions against removable aliens encountered during the performance of their official duties.” Translation: Every undocumented and deportable immigrant would now be fair game      Gone are the tiers of enforcement that the Obama administration put forth Even as Trump himself says that he wants to rid the country of the “rapists” and “murderers” among the immigrant population, Kelly has pursued a policy that targets all undocumented immigrants Kelly’s policy effectively blurs the line between who is an “immigrant” and who is a “criminal”—despite what Trump says On a practical level, immigration agents no longer have to think carefully about whether an undocumented immigrant they come across is a priority, because anyone who’s undocumented can go As a result, those with no criminal records or those with the most minor of infractions are as much at risk as those with serious convictions Current Issue View our current issue      Trump’s supporters have taken him at his word “I think our president is going to keep all the good people here,” Helen Beristain, a Trump voter, told CNN this spring, as her husband, Roberto Beristain, faced deportation He had not been convicted of a crime “He’s not going to tear up families I don’t think he wants to do that He just wants to keep us safe,” Beristain said of Trump Roberto was later deported      2) Redefining who a “criminal alien” is      In those same February memos, Kelly also expanded the notion of a “criminal alien.” Now a “removable alien” is anyone who has been convicted of a crime, been charged with a crime, or even committed anything that might be a “chargeable criminal offense” (jaywalking, anyone?) Immigrants who committed any kind of fraud (like using a fake Social Security number) or abused any public benefit would also be a priority for deportation, alongside anyone who had an order of removal that they’d ignored But perhaps most stunning, Kelly directed the department to pursue anyone who, “in the judgment of an immigration officer,” posed a national-security risk to the country In other words, any and every immigrant could be targeted by an immigration official      This change blew the doors wide open and has resulted in high-profile incidents of longtime undocumented immigrants’ being detained during routine check-ins, such as Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a Phoenix mom who was deported in February after an immigration check-in In 2008, Garcia de Rayos was arrested during a raid at the water park where she worked She was caught using a fake Social Security number, and far from hiding afterwards, the longtime Arizona resident faithfully went to every check-in at a local ICE office since then      The effect of Kelly’s memos has been to offer immigration agents new freedom to go further into communities to detain and arrest immigrants Far from nabbing criminal masterminds, ICE agents have instead been reaching for the most vulnerable undocumented immigrants In February, ICE agents turned up at a Texas courthouse and detained a woman fleeing domestic abuse She was there seeking a protective order against her boyfriend, but left under arrest by ICE Also in February, ICE agents waited outside a Virginia church’s hypothermia shelter and arrested two men In May, ICE agents crossed an unspoken line regarding immigration-law enforcement when they entered P.S 58, a Queens, New York, elementary school, to inquire about a fourth grader      3) Calling for the revival of 287(g)      Most interior immigration-law enforcement—that is, enforcement that happens away from the border—depends on the cooperation of local law-enforcement agencies There simply are not enough federal resources to pursue every undocumented immigrant that the Trump administration would like to pursue In order to accomplish Trump’s goals, Kelly called for a return to old programs, like 287(g), which deputizes local and state police officers to act as immigration agents      Together with Jeff Sessions’s pressure on sanctuary cities, the two are bearing down on localities that want to keep the work of public safety and immigration-law enforcement separate Already, police arrests funnel undocumented immigrants into the deportation system But under Kelly and Sessions, increasingly, police have become immigration agents      4) Ending DAPA      DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents) refers to a never-implemented program from the Obama years which would have offered the parents of undocumented DREAMer youth and green-card holders short-term protection from deportation Last month, Kelly formally dismantled the program      DAPA was an expansion of the successful initiative DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which gave select undocumented young people work permits and protection from deportation for two years Nearly 800,000 young people have taken advantage of the program, which allowed them to get jobs, pursue education, and build their careers It’s also been good for the economy A Center for American Progress survey found that 20 percent of surveyed DACA recipients bought a car after obtaining DACA, and that one in 12 even bought a home DAPA, however, got stalled in the courts after dozens of states led by Texas sued the Obama administration The program would have benefitted an estimated 4 million undocumented immigrants, but the Trump administration decided not to defend the program in court      5) Weighing the expanded use of expedited removal      This month, a leaked DHS memo revived an idea which was originally tucked into Kelly’s original February memos The memo called for expanding the use of expedited removal, which is the practice of bypassing immigration courts and summarily shoving people out of the country As of 2004, its use was limited to those who were apprehended within 100 miles of the US-Mexico border and who couldn’t prove that they’d been in the country for more than two weeks      The new proposal would greatly expand the policy to include anyone apprehended anywhere in the country who hadn’t been in the United States for more than 90 days This policy change would hand immigration officers even more power over the fates of the people they detain This, to be clear, is just a proposal But even in 2013, 44 percent of removals happened via expedited removal      If Kelly’s short tenure is any indication, his elevated role as White House chief of staff will be a disaster for immigrants, never mind who replaces him at Homeland Security, a process in which he will undoubtedly play a large part ", "summary": "",

Updated By Dartunorro Clark      John Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, is a retired four-star Marine general who served in the military for over four decades      Kelly, 67, one of the nation's longest-serving commanders, came into Donald Trump’s orbit because of positions on terrorism and immigration that mirrored the president's He equates leaks, which have plagued the administration, with treason and knows how to work the halls of Congress, which the White House has also had trouble doing      Trump named Kelly as his chief of staff Friday afternoon in the administration's latest shakeup Kelly was not involved in the 2016 campaign and didn't support any of the candidates He said only that he would be happy to serve in a Republican administration      Kelly, 67, was born in Brighton, a working-class Boston enclave that he described to NPR in 2015 as a very, very, very Marine town      So, back in my neighborhood in Boston, a working-class neighborhood, when you got your draft notice, you went down, and you took your draft physical And then, if you passed it, you joined the Marine Corps, he told NPR      And he did just that In 1970, Kelly enlisted in the Marines By 1972, he was discharged as a sergeant and enrolled at the University of Massachusetts, according to an online biography After graduating he went right back into the military, serving a storied four-decade career, garnering respect from both sides of the political aisle and admiration from military officers      He led the Southern Command, where he oversaw U.S military operations in South and Central America, including the southern border, and he formed a tough immigration stance      The border is, if not wide open, then certainly open enough to get what the demand requires inside of the country, Kelly told the House Armed Services Committee in 2015      He doubled down on that sentiment earlier this year when he appeared before the House Homeland Security Committee and said he believes that smugglers were bringing tens of thousands of people to our nation’s doorstep from across the border mostly from Central America and Mexico      As a nation, control of our borders is paramount, he added      When Trump tapped Kelly to lead Homeland Security he called him the right person to spearhead the urgent mission of stopping illegal immigration and securing our borders      Kelly also commanded Marines during some of the most intense fighting during the Iraq war, in which two of his sons also served      In 2010, one of Kelly’s sons, Marine 1st Lt Robert Michael Kelly, 29, was killed in combat in Afghanistan after stepping on a land mine, making Kelly the highest-ranking military officer to lose a child during the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan Kelly’s wife, Karen, started a scholarship in her son’s name      The commander of the US Southern Command, General John Kelly (C) arrives at the Guatemalan Air Force base on March 2, 2015 in Guatemala City File Johan Ordonez / AFP/Getty Images file      In picking Kelly, Trump may also be betting on getting his agenda through Congress more effectively      In 2004, Kelly came back from a two-year command position in Iraq and served as the legislative liaison for the Marines until 2007, before retiring in 2015 from the military      Since Priebus’ fate was tied the failure of congressional Republicans to repeal Obamacare, a source told NBC News, Kelly’s ability to rub elbows with lawmakers could be a plus for the White House      Aside from being in lockstep with Trump on immigration matters, he has also sided with the president on sensitive issues, such as leaks, which have riled the administration on multiple occasion      Kelly told Meet The Press earlier this year intelligence leaks were darn close to treason      In the same interview, he also defended the president on Russia, particularly a report that indicated White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner had proposed a secret communication channel with the Kremlin so that discussions before the inauguration could not be detected      I don’t see any big issue here relative to Jared, Kelly said of the report, which Kushner also has since denied ", "summary": "Kelly has said \"smugglers\" are bringing \"tens of thousands of people to our nation's doorstep.\" He's also called leaks \"darn close to

University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, studying criminal justice He previously served in the U.S Air Force and recently enlisted in the U.S Army, Styka said      He also had been training as a member of the

happy guy      I mean, he had his share of problems like anybody else, but I could never imagine him randomly shooting people, Kelley said in an online interview Monday while serving at an Air Force

said It's the loss of a family member when we lost her husband and daughter, and we're worried for her      Styka said the shooting spree could have been worse considering the weapons and ammunition Valencia del Toro had Two handguns — a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and a revolver — were fired, and Styka said at least six to 10 rounds were spent      The chief said Valencia del Toro shot the Stoffels and Bentdahl with the pistol and then shot himself with the revolver      Valencia del Toro had a holster on his right hip and ammunition on his left hip when he arrived at Theda Clark for

For Mr Balin, Jefferson Airplane was focused on live performance, not commercial formula “We got to a place where the music was playing us, we weren’t playing it,” he told Relix magazine in 1993 “That’s where you want to get to And from the first note you hit, no matter where you are, even in the biggest hall in the world, from the first note of the first song, you know at that moment you are there or you’re not.”      Mr Balin stayed with Jefferson Airplane through three more studio albums that have endured as psychedelic touchstones: “After Bathing at Baxter’s,” “Crown of Creation” and “Volunteers,” for which he and Mr Kantner wrote the title track Yet the escalating tension within the band, along with his sorrow at the death of a friend, Janis Joplin, in 1970, led to his departure from Jefferson Airplane in 1971      Mr Kantner invited Mr Balin to complete a song that became “Caroline” on Jefferson Starship’s 1974 album, “Dragon Fly,” with Mr Balin on lead vocals He joined the band as a full member in 1975 and was its frontman for pop successes including “Miracles,” “Count on Me,” “Runaway” and “With Your Love” before leaving in 1978 ", "summary": "", "summary_all": "– A major figure in the emergence of psychedelic rock in the 1960s has died Marty Balin, who co-founded Jefferson Airplane and played on and off with its later iteration, Jefferson Starship, died en route to the hospital in Tampa, Florida, at age 76, reports the New York Times The cause of death wasn't immediately known The Times calls Balin a \"prime mover in the flowering of psychedelic rock in mid-1960s San Francisco,\" not only through the band he co-founded in 1965 but through a nightclub he owned called the Matrix Rolling Stone has a detailed obituary on Balin's interesting career, noting that he was a struggling folk guitarist when he met another guitarist named Paul Kantner and decided to form a band Other original Airplane members were guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, bassist Jack Casady, drummer Skip Spence, and singer Signe Toly Anderson, but the band didn't truly take off until Anderson left and was replaced by Grace Slick in 1967, notes Rolling Stone Balin wrote or co-wrote many of the songs, and his \"high and soulful\" voice became a signature sound for the group, per Variety (Here is \"Comin' Back to Me.\") But he was also a savvy businessman, as this old quote from the late Kanter shows: “He was the leader of the band on that level He was the one who pushed us to do all the business stuff, orchestrating, thinking ahead, looking for managers and club opportunities He was very good at it.”"}
{"article_number": 1643, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " Marty Balin, a co-founder of Jefferson Airplane and a member of its later incarnation Jefferson Starship, whose high and soulful voice defined many of both groups’ songs, died Thursday, his rep confirmed He was 76; the cause of death was not announced      His wife, Susan Joy Balin, was “by his side,” according to the announcement      Although Balin had his greatest impact as one of the architects of the musical counterculture during his 1965-71 tenure in Jefferson Airplane, he had his greatest commercial success when he rejoined the remnants of that group a few years later in Jefferson Starship, as the sole lead singer on both of that band’s singles to reach the top 10, “Miracles” in 1975 and “Count on Me” in 1978      He was a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, having been inducted with other members of the Airplane in 1996 It was 20 years later that the band received the Recording Academy’s lifetime achievement award, with Patti Smith writing in the Grammy Awards’ program book about her appreciation for “the soaring combination of Grace Slick’s acerbic wit and fearless charisma and the romantic purity of Marty Balin.”      Born Martyn Jerel Buchwald, Balin was a young folksinger in San Francisco when he formed a band with fellow folkie Paul Kantner, who specialized in 12-string guitar The pair teamed up with guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, bassist Jack Casady, drummer Skip Spence and singer Signe Anderson as the Jefferson Airplane and released their debut album, “Jefferson Airplane Takes Off,” in 1966 Anderson and Spence soon left the band and were replaced by Grace Slick and Spencer Dryden, respectively, and the group’s 1967 album “Surrealistic Pillow” — featuring the Slick-sung hits “White Rabbit” and “Somebody to Love,” along with several songs co-written by Balin — vaulted the group into superstardom The harmonies between Slick, Balin and Kantner became a signature of the group’s sound      Balin was a galvanizing member of both the band and the San Francisco scene, and in 1965 helped launch a club in the city called the Matrix that hosted many groups of the era, ranging from the Airplane, the Doors and Janis Joplin to the Velvet Underground He sold his interest in the club after the Airplane’s star began to rise      Jefferson Airplane issued several more albums into the early 1970s and played at both Woodstock and Altamont (where he was famously knocked out by a Hell’s Angel after trying to intervene amid the violence)      The group splintered in the early 1970s but several members, including Slick and Kantner, reunited as Jefferson Starship in the mid-‘70s, and Balin was persuaded to reunite with his former partners during the recording of their debut album His high tenor voice became a centerpiece of the group’s sound via hits like “Miracles” and “With Your Love.” That group splintered as well before reuniting without Balin several years later as a pure pop outfit under the abbreviated name Starship      Balin went solo and enjoyed a top 10 hit of his own in 1981 with the song “Hearts.” In 1989, he joined up with a short-lived Airplane reunion tour and returned four years later to Jefferson Starship, finally leaving for good in 2008 His final solo album, “The Greatest Love,” was released in early 2016      He underwent open-heart surgery in 2016 and later sued New York’s Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital for medical malpractice, claiming multiple injuries from the operations Balin’s illness rendered him unable to attend the Grammys when the Airplane was awarded lifetime achievement honors, but he released a statement at the time, saying, “”I am grateful for the beautiful musical journey my life continues to take To all my fellow Jefferson Airplane Band members, through its various metamorphoses, I thank you for a dream come true.”      In a statement, Susan and Balin’s family issued a statement that noted how Balin “also

{"article_number": 1643, "article_idx": 2, "article_text": " Jefferson Airplane vocalist-guitarist Marty Balin, who co-founded the San Francisco psychedelic rock band in 1965 and played a crucial role in the creation of all their 1960s albums, including Surrealistic Pillow and Volunteers, died Thursday at the age of 76 Balin’s rep confirmed the musician’s death to Rolling Stone, though the cause of death is currently unknown      “RIP Marty Balin, fellow bandmate and music traveler passed last night,” Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady said in a statement “A great songwriter and singer who loved life and music We shared some wonderful times together We will all miss you!!!!”      “Marty and I were young together in a time that defined our lives,” Jefferson Airplane guitarist Jorma Kaukonen wrote on his blog “Had it not been for him, my life would have taken an alternate path I cannot imagine He and Paul Kantner came together and like plutonium halves in a reactor started a chain reaction that still affects many of us today It was a moment of powerful synchronicity I was part of it to be sure, but I was not a prime mover Marty always reached for the stars and he took us along with him.”      Born Martyn Jerel Buchwald, Balin was a struggling folk guitarist on the San Francisco scene when he formed a band with Paul Kantner after meeting the 12-string guitarist at a hootenanny They met up with Kaukonen, Casady, drummer Skip Spence and singer Signe Toly Anderson, and cut their 1966 debut LP, Jefferson Airplane Takes Off They developed a strong following around the budding San Francisco rock scene, but became nationwide superstars in 1967 when Anderson left the group and was replaced by Grace Slick      Balin co-wrote five songs on their breakthrough LP, Surrealistic Pillow, including “Comin’ Back to Me” and album opener “She Has Funny Cars,” and his tenor voice became a key component of their signature sound He played with the group at all of its most famous gigs, including the 1967 Human Be-In in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park, the Monterey Pop Festival, Woodstock and Altamont At the latter gig, Balin was brutally beaten by the Hells Angels after he dived into the audience to help an audience member in distress “I woke up with all these boot marks all over my body,” he told Relix in 1993 “I just walked out there I remember Jorma saying, ‘Hey, you’re a crazy son of a bitch.’ ”      A little over a year later, Balin quit the group “I thought everybody [was] kind of an asshole,” he said earlier this year “It was a period of cocaine then.…Everybody took cocaine And people I would work with, they would yell at you and it got intense The Airplane was on that kind of trip You know, I personally just drank alcohol But some of the chemicals made people crazy and very selfish, and it just wasn’t any fun to be around for me So I bailed.”      Balin spent a few years managing rock bands in San Francisco, but he was pulled back into the group’s orbit by Kantner in 1974, though by that point Casady and Kaukonen had defected and the remaining members were billing themselves as Jefferson Starship The offshoot band was incredibly successful and scored more hits than the original Airplane, including the Balin-penned “Miracles,” from Red Octopus, hitting Number Three in 1975 But by 1978, Balin grew tired of touring, especially since Slick’s alcohol issues caused many uneven performances, and he left the group for a solo career In 1989, he participated in the short-lived Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and returned four years later to Jefferson Starship, finally leaving for good in 2008      In 2016, Balin underwent open-heart surgery at Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in New York He later sued for medical malpractice, claiming negligence caused him a myriad of injuries, including a paralyzed vocal cord, bedsores, kidney damage, and the loss of his left thumb and half his tongue ", "summary": "–

would have thought the explosion happened inside the office, said station owner Fahim Hashimy      He said the station's creative director, Sohail Sediqi -- who Hashimy said was known in the office for his fear of such attacks -- had gone down to the blast site to try to get footage on air right after the bomb went off, despite a forehead wound      This gave me a very big hope, to be honest It showed me that we won't give up, Hashimy said      Layma Tabibi, an Afghan-American who works at a local consulting firm, heard the blast and told CNN a lot of casualties appeared to be from the Roshan telecommunications company      Afghans It's always Afghans, she said, when asked who suffered in such attacks It's always Afghans that are harmed and get killed, rather than who the attacker wants to target      Roshan mobile company employees leave the site of the attack in Kabul on Wednesday      Many phone lines were down but people were trying to help, she said      The people are full of hope and love It may not always seem like that but already there are hundreds of names and people waiting in lines and waiting to be put on a waiting list to donate blood and help anyone who is in need or stranded without help      Hameed Hakim, who works for a French nonprofit group, was on his way to work in Kabul's Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood when the noise of the blast stopped him in his tracks      It was so crazy The sound was very strong and the ground shook Everyone around me was shocked All of the buildings and offices were broken, the windows were blown out, he said It was rush hour, most of the people were going to their offices or going to the shops There were large crowds of people going about their days      Frantic relatives search for news      Josh Smith, a correspondent for Reuters news agency in Kabul, headed to a major city hospital just a few blocks away from the blast site      I saw a steady stream of ambulances that had been carrying wounded begin arriving with bodies, many of which were burned or maimed beyond recognition, he said      Frantic relatives were mobbing casualty lists and the arriving ambulances looking for news Several of the wounded who were able to talk to me described utter destruction and chaos after the blast All over streets blocks away people were cleaning up broken glass      Emergency workers were still pulling bodies from under the rubble and several buildings had collapsed      I heard a very loud bang and then I don't remember what happened next, said survivor Wasim Shah, 40, from a hospital bed, his head bandaged The waves of the explosion were so powerful that you can see a lot of people in the hospital wounded by shattered windows and collapsed walls      Attack 'sign of weakness'      Capt Bill Salvin, a US military spokesman in Kabul, told CNN that a checkpoint had prevented the truck getting closer into the diplomatic quarter      Security forces stand near the site of the bombing on Wednesday      Today's attack is a very dramatic example of what terrorists can do when they are determined to cause death and suffering among innocent civilians, he said But the security situation is being stabilized by the ever-growing capability of the Afghan police force and the Afghan National Army      Operation Resolute Support, the NATO-led international mission to support Afghan forces, is focused this year on building Afghan forces' offensive capability on the battlefield, Salvin added      US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson condemned the senseless and cowardly act, and pledged

We can't say because neither Press Secretary Jay Carney nor anyone from his staff would speak on the record      Other sources confirmed that Carla was vanquished, including Chronicle editor Ward Bushee, who said he was informed that Carla was removed as a pool reporter Which shouldn't be a secret in any case because it's a fact that affects the newsgathering of our largest regional paper (and sfgate)and how local citizens get their information      What's worse: more than a few journalists familiar with this story are aware of some implied threats from the White House of additional and wider punishment if Carla's spanking became public Really? That's a heavy hand usually reserved for places other than the land of the free      But bravery is a challenge, in particular for White House correspondents, most of whom are seasoned and capable journalists They live a little bit in a gilded cage where they have access to the most powerful man in the world but must obey the rules whether they make sense or not      CBS News reporter, Mark Knoller, has publicly protested the limited press access to Obama fundraisers, calling the policy inconsistent It's no way to do business, wrote Politico's Julie Mason, especially [for] a candidate who prides himself on transparency      A 2009 blog by the White House Director of New Media states that President Obama is committed to making his administration the most open and transparent in history      Not last week      Mason referred to the San Francisco St Regis protest as a highly newsworthy event where reporters had to rely on written pool reports..      Except, thanks to Carla's quick action with her camera, they didn't      I get that all powerful people and institutions want to control their image and their message That's part of their job, to create a mythology that allows them to continue being powerful      But part of the press' job is to do the opposite, to strip away the cloaks and veneers By banning her, and by not acknowledging how contemporary media works, the White House did not just put Carla in a cage but more like one of those stifling pens reserved for calves on their way to being veal      Carla cannot do her job to the best of her ability if she can't use all the tools available to her as a journalist The public still sees the videos posted by protesters and other St Regis attendees, because the technology is ubiquitous But the Obama Administration apparently wants to give the distinct advantage to citizen witnesses at the expense of professionals      Why? Well, they won't tell us      Some White House reporters are grumbling almost as much as the Administration about Carla's breaking the rules I can understand how they'd be irritated If you didn't get the video because you understood you weren't supposed to, why should someone else get it who isn't following the longstanding civilized table manners?      The White House Press Correspondents' Association pool reporting guidelines warn about no hoarding of information and also say, pool reports must be filed before any online story or blog While uploading her video probably was the best way to file her report, Carla may have technically busted the letter of that law      But the guidelines also say, Print poolers can snap pictures or take video They are not obliged to share these pictures...but can make them available if they so choose      Then what guidelines is the White House applying here?

morning and the rig caught fire later Tuesday night when the leaking natural gas ignited, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement confirmed early Wednesday morning            No one was on board at the time of the ignition and no one was injured, according to BSEE The burning rig is southwest of Grand Isle, about 55 miles offshore, authorities said            BSEE and Coast Guard officials flew over the site on Wednesday morning and BSEE stated that there was no sheen observed on the water surface A sheen a mile long by 50 feet wide had been reported during a flyover Tuesday      As the rig fire continued, the beams supporting the derrick and rig floor folded and collapsed over the rig structure, BSEE stated      The Coast Guard confirmed the rig caught fire at 10:45 p.m Tuesday BSEE said the source of the ignition was not known            The National Response Center, which takes calls about spills and other industrial incidents, received a report around 11 a.m Tuesday from a caller who said a drilling rig incurred a well blow resulting in a release of approximately 7 barrels an hour, according to the report The description of the incident also lists that 47 people had been evacuated from the rig, although that number later was corrected to 44 evacuees      Coast Guard and BSEE officials would not immediately comment on the report's accuracy or who had reported the release of crude oil Often, the National Response Center is notified of an incident and then the response center contacts the local Coast Guard office, which will check out the report      But Frank Maisano, a media consultant for Hercules Offshore, said that was a very preliminary report and probably is in error      It is definitely a gas leak There is definitely no crude oil at all, Maisano said on Wednesday afternoon      The rig is owned by Hercules Offshore, based in Houston, and operated by Houston-based Walter Oil & Gas Corp., according to BSEE      Jim Noe, an executive vice president with rig owner Hercules Offshore, said on Wednesday that the well was about 8,000-feet below the surface of the seafloor      Our singular focus right now is to regain control of the well, Noe said After that, we will look for a root cause to what happened, try to find out how this accident happened in the first place      The blowout occurred as Walter Oil & Gas was completing work on a sidetrack well to prepare that well for new production, according to BSEE A sidetrack well uses the same hole as the original well but then spreads to a new location at the same depth      Walter Oil and Gas Corp engaged Wild Well Control Inc to help control the leak, Noe said      Eileen Angelico, a BSEE spokeswoman, said on Wednesday that the well had a blowout preventer, but no determinations have been made as to whether the blowout preventer was activated or functioned properly      That will be part of BSEE's comprehensive investigation into the cause of the loss of well control, Angelico said      Noe said that, once things settle, we will certainly start looking at potential causes, including the BOP, referencing the blowout preventer      The failure of a blowout preventer played a central role in the BP disaster in the Gulf in 2010 That catastrophe resulted in 11 deaths and millions of gallons of crude oil spewing into the Gulf But authorities say this

expected to draw more than 15,000 sport and recreational fishers and tourists to Grand Isle Jefferson Parish Council Chairman Chris Roberts said Wednesday morning that there are no changes expected to the Tarpon Rodeo because of the fire, except that there will be a 5-mile safe zone around the rig            BSEE had stated on Tuesday that a firefighting vessel was expected to be on location on Tuesday evening with both water and foam fire fighting abilities The Coast Guard cutter is on the scene maintaining a 500-meter safety zone, assuring that no vessels or persons get close to the

startup company that made a splash at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show is selling a seemingly irresistible concept: A wearable device that gives you all the benefits of a runner’s high, minus the pesky tradition of actually running      Cat Ear Headphones Approach Terminal Cuteness      Dubbed Nervana, the device pairs with your phone or music player to add low-power electric nerve stimulation to the audio feed going into your ear According to the design team, the electrical pulse — timed with the beat of the music — triggers the brain’s vagus nerve, which in turn releases feel-good brain chemicals like dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin These are the “reward” chemicals that the brain generates in response to stimuli like exercise or sex      Artificial stimulation of the vagus nerve is nothing new, Nervana’s developers say But they’ve come up with a way to do it without surgery or other invasive techniques The device’s proprietary earbud technology delivers electrical stimulation to the inside surface of the ear canal and, thereby, the vagus nerve, according to the company’s promotional materials      What’s more, the Nervana headphones analyze the audio signal coming in from your music player then generate targeted vagus nerve stimulation synchronized with the music signal Or not: In ambient mode, the headphones don’t need an electronic input signal at all — they’ll key the nerve pulses to go along with whatever music or sound is in the immediate environment At a concert, say      Hack Your Brain to Improve Your Health      As of now, there’s not much hard evidence backing up the company’s claims And since the device is being marketed as a lifestyle and wellness device, the company doesn’t need any medical or FDA approval But the Nervana development team has several MDs on board, and anecdotal reports from this year’s CES suggest that something is going on with the Nervana headphones      The company plans to start selling pre-orders for the $299

{"article_number": 3324, "article_idx": 2, "article_text": " All of the Fun, None of the Workout      If you think about it, every company exhibiting at CES is trying to sell the same thing: happiness But of the booths I visited last week at the yearly electronics trade show in Las Vegas, only one delivered directly on that promise      Nervana (not to be confused with Nervana Systems), a startup founded by a team of medical professionals with day jobs as doctors and nurses, makes hardware that stimulates your brain to release dopamine, aka the happiness chemical      The brain naturally responds to stimuli from exercise, music, sex, drugs, gambling, and other activities with a hit of dopamine, which makes us feel a rush of pleasure Experts in women’s brain physiology say dopamine has special effects for women.Naomi Wolf summarizes their findings in her book, calling dopamine “the ultimate feminist chemical”, essential to a woman’s ability to feel confident and creative      I tried Nervana with a few friends (I’ll refer to them as Conor, Joel, and Agustina since those are their names), and even though our sample size is small, we experienced happiness sensations that we believe resulted from the trial      Conor and Joel said they felt an electric prickle when they first put on the headset, which intensified as they cranked up the volume and the intensity of their experience on the generator The prickling persisted through the 15 or so minutes of music (you could choose from a list of 10 or so tracks that included Michael Jackson, Justin Bieber, and ambient noise) For about an hour afterward, they both felt unusually calm and happy; Conor also claimed the device cured his hangover      Agustina and I felt much more powerful sensations while trying Nervana, consistent with Naomi Wolf’s convictions about women’s reactions to dopamine      “I felt the electricity go into my arm, and everything was tingling there, but the best moment for me was afterwards when I finished and stood up,” Agustina said “I felt like I reached a personal high point I couldn’t stop smiling or laughing I was like, ‘Oh wow’ For about five minutes, my happiness level was a 10 out of 10 Then it got foggier, but I was still unusually happy for about an hour.”      My experience was close to Agustina’s, except possibly even fuller, since I cranked up the intensity on the generator to the maximum, so that I perceived waves of feeling caused by the stimulation even while the music was still playing For me, the effect was so intense it felt beyond doubt that it was caused by the device      If Nervana does what it claims (and what we experienced subjectively), the potential benefits are almost limitless, ranging from recreational to therapeutic Not only could it be used as a therapy on people suffering with depression, anxiety, and probably a host of other disorders, it could also potentially replace party drugs like molly by delivering a high and enhancing the immersive quality of music without posing the health risk      “Taking something that basically poisons our bodies can be deadly, unfortunately, but Nervana can enhance the pleasure of music without any drugs,” said Dr Daniel Cartledge, one of the MD’s on the founding team “I think this could add great entertainment value to music festivals.”      We conducted our own science experiment      One of Nervana’s greatest challenges is to prove objectively that the product works Its founders haven’t discovered a way to quantify the amount of dopamine in the brain at a given time They don’t have any means of gathering quantitative data other than users self-reporting happiness on a standard mood scale      Luckily, Conor and Joel happen to be the cofounders (and CEO and president, respectively) of Open BCI, a brain-computer interface company that produces the Ultracortex: a device you can wear on your head that monitors your brain activity      So we decided to use the Ultracortex to test the Nervana experience Conor wore the Ultracortex, which collected his EEG data before, during, and after the stimulation Since Open BCI collects data, but doesn’t analyze it, we’re still waiting for the official results to come back from the experts      Joel watched Conor’s EEG on a monitor while he was being stimulated, and said that although no huge changes were easily perceptible to a casual observer, he might’ve seen an increase in the frequency of alpha waves during Nervana      “There may have been some more alpha wave activity in the 25-30 hertz range,” Joel said, “but watching it live, it’s difficult to know.”      Here’s where the cofounders explain everything to me And sex      I spoke with two of the cofounders, its nurse CEO Ami Brannon and electrical engineer Gregory Mayback, about just what it was exactly that they’d done to my brain (Note: The interview has been condensed and edited for brevity and clarity.)      Me: Want to explain what you just did to me for the past 15 minutes?      Ami: We have a device that sends an electrical signal through the ear canal to stimulate the release of dopamine in your brain There’s an electrical signal that’s paired with music It follows the beat of the music, and and it makes it really pleasant Through a conductive earbud, it sends a message through the vagus nerve in your ear, which sends a message to the brain to release dopamine, your feel-good neurotransmitter that naturally occurs in the brain      Me: What’s the vagus nerve, and how does it tell my brain to release dopamine?      Ami: The vagus nerve is the longest cranial nerve in your body, and through it, we can access the parasympathetic nervous system, which is the part of the nervous system that helps the body to relax and feel good It elicits those warm feelings like when you feel love Dopamine is commonly associated with the feeling of being in love We kind of tickle the nerve to remind it to send out some dopamine      Me: Is there any danger to stimulating the vagus nerve to produce dopamine when it wouldn’t necessarily do so, or more often than it would naturally?      Ami: No There are actually several decades of science behind vagus nerve stimulation Historically, vagus nerve stimulators have only been implanted through surgery Our team is made up of physicians, medical researchers, and engineers who knew about the vagus nerve implant surgery, and that the nerve stimulates a nice feeling So bringing that feeling to consumers without the surgery was our goal from the beginning      Me: Wow, I’ve never heard of a vagus nerve implant surgery What kind of person gets a surgery like that, to treat what kind of condition?      Ami: The surgery has been used as a treatment for epilepsy, depression, obesity, and more Recently a surgically implanted vagus nerve stimulation device got FDA indications for obesity But those are medical devices We’re a lifestyle and wellness device, and we’re not seeking FDA approval or making medical claims      Me: And yet, you clearly think this would be of interest to people suffering from certain medical conditions, as consumers Tell me about that      Ami: As a company we’ll eventually look at delving into the medical device world I think universities will be very interested in using this They haven’t been able to to treat patients effectively since often surgery isn’t an option      Me: Honestly if I had one of these sets I’d be doing this every day Are you sure there isn’t any harm in doing this over and over? How often do you guys do it?      Ami: Based on all the literature that’s out there, there’s really no harm We actually don’t have a device ourselves right now, but the engineers building the devices try them out all the time We start pre-sale of the device in the next week or two on our site, and then we’ll be delivering it in the spring The price point is $299, which we think is pretty reasonable      Me: Explain to me the connection to music I was encouraged to turn the music to the highest volume that was enjoyable, I cranked up the intensity, and I started noticing the effects as the beat dropped Is that what you expected?      Greg: Yes, that’s the intent of adding it to music The signal rides the wave of the music itself The music is playing at a particular frequency, the the signal follows the rhythm Every once in a while, it’ll be off because it happens to be following one instrument rather than another, but it follows in a pleasurable way      Me: Do you need music in order to have the experience?      Greg: No, you just need to be wearing the headset      Ami: It’s a very personal device, you can completely adjust the settings You can kind of play around with the settings, like, do I want to feel more intense signal? Do I feel that good feeling more if I increase the signal or do I just want a little mild setting?      Me: I can see so many applications of this at festivals and concerts Have you thought about that?      Ami: We do have a mode on the generator called ambient mode We have the microphone on there, so that if you’re at a festival, everyone can get the same signal at the same time all listening to the same DJ or whatever      Me: I’ve got to ask you guys about drugs Any comments on how the experience of this compares, potentially, to a substance like ecstasy or MDMA?      Greg: I couldn’t comment because I just drink alcohol      Me: Ok, what about sex? Have you thought about demoing Nervana with sex?      Ami: Yes! We talk about it all the time, but we haven’t been able to decide yet who gets to go first We all volunteer I think there’s an applicability there, heightening the pleasure experience in what already is a good thing We started off being a device to help you relax, but in what situation is pleasure better than when you’re relaxed? So sex is definitely at the top of our list      Me: Would you ever consider this within the realm of augmented reality (AR)?      Greg: Oh sure, absolutely Why wouldn’t it be? When you talk about virtual reality, you’re talking about five or six senses, depending on who you are But when you’re looking and feeling something, why wouldn’t you also want to, like, hear a truck go by and have a signal there that makes you feel something different?

The company doesn’t go into a lot of detail, but it does say it’s an APT Group, which stands for “Advanced Persistent Threat.” FireEye generally saves that designation for the most serious and technically sophisticated of attackers      “The APT group responsible for this exploit has been the first group to have access to a select number of browser-based Zero-Day exploits in the past,” FireEye explains “They are extremely proficient at lateral movement and are difficult to track, as they typically do not reuse command and control infrastructure.”      FireEye says this same group was tied to a backdoor vulnerability known as Pirpi that appeared in 2010 ", "summary": "– A new security headache for the estimated 56% of Web users who use Internet Explorer: A major security flaw has surfaced in some versions of the browser, leaving users open to a \"remote code execution vulnerability,\" which \"means a bad guy can make a target computer run software after a successful attack,\" Recode explains Microsoft says most attacks occur when a user clicks on a link that leads to a malicious website and the bug affects every Explorer version from 6 to 11", "summary_all": "– A new security headache for the estimated 56% of Web users who use Internet Explorer: A major security flaw has surfaced in some versions of the browser, leaving users open to a \"remote code execution vulnerability,\" which \"means a bad guy can make a target computer run software after a successful attack,\" Recode explains Microsoft says most attacks occur when a user clicks on a link that leads to a malicious website and the bug affects every Explorer version from 6 to 11 Microsoft plans to roll out a security update for current versions of Windows, but it looks like Windows XP users are on their own, the Wall Street Journal reports Microsoft ended support for the outdated operating system earlier this month, and although it still runs on around 300 million machines, it's not clear whether Microsoft will make an exception and issue a security patch for the latest flaw \"XP users are not safe anymore and this is the first vulnerability that will be not patched for their system,\" a Symantec researcher warns."}
{"article_number": 2215, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "(CNN) Excessive alcohol use could increase your risk for all types of dementia, particularly early-onset dementia, according to a new study      The study, published Tuesday in the journal Lancet Public Health, looked at over 1 million adults released from French hospitals between 2008 and 2013 who were diagnosed with dementia, a clinical syndrome characterized by a progressive deterioration in cognitive ability      Using data from the French National Hospital Discharge database, the researchers found that alcohol-use disorders were diagnosed in 16.5% of the men with dementia and 4% of the women with dementia -- over twice as much as in those without dementia for both sexes      Alcohol-use disorders refer to the chronic harmful use of alcohol or alcohol dependence, the researchers wrote      In order to isolate the role of alcohol use, patients with neurological disorders such as Parkinson's and Huntington's , which can also lead to dementia, were excluded from the study      The most novel result is the large contribution of alcohol-use disorders to the burden of dementia over the lifespan, said Dr Michael Schwarzinger, a researcher at the Transitional Health Economics Network in Paris and a leading author of the study      The association was particularly strong for those with early-onset dementia, diagnosed when the patient is younger than 65 Over half of the individuals in the early-onset group had alcohol-related dementia or an additional diagnosis of alcohol-use disorder      Given the strength of the association, what is the most surprising to me is that alcohol-use disorders had received so little interest in dementia research and public health policies, Schwarzinger said      How alcohol might damage the brain      Although many studies have shown a strong association between excessive alcohol use and dementia, this study is unique in its findings about early-onset dementia, according to Dr Kostas Lyketsos, a neuropsychiatry professor and director of the Johns Hopkins Memory and Alzheimer's Treatment Center who was not involved in the study      That is rather unique, Lyketsos said It does remind us that alcoholics have shorter life expectancies      The study was also among the largest of its kind But, according to Lyketsos, the large size could leave the study open to selection bias      There's a tradeoff between size and precision of the variables, he said The more people you have, the less confidence you have in the elements that go into the diagnosis of dementia      I also want to point out that this was really a sample of hospitalized individuals It's very unusual for people with dementia, at least in the milder stages, to be hospitalized, he added      Research suggests multiple ways heavy alcohol use can lead to dementia First, ethanol and its byproduct acetaldehyde are known to have a toxic effect on the brain that can lead to long-term structural and functional brain damage, Schwarzinger says      Heavy alcohol use can also lead to a condition called hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by a loss in brain function due to increases of ammonia in the blood caused by liver damage      Heavy drinking is also strongly associated with vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure or diabetes mellitus as well as cardiovascular diseases, Schwarzinger added      Lastly, heavy drinking clusters (in) people with less education, smoking habits, and/or depression All of these factors were found to be independent risk factors for dementia onset      Though heavy alcohol use increased the risk of dementia in general, the association was shown to be stronger in men      When other factors were not controlled for, heavy drinking was associated with a higher risk of dementia among both men and women In men, the risk was increased by a factor of 4.7, while in women, it increased by a factor of 4.3      But even when the researchers controlled for factors like high blood pressure, obesity and tobacco smoking, heavy alcohol use was still associated with a more than threefold increase in dementia among both sexes      Results differed by sex      The study also showed that the average age of dementia onset differed between men and women Men were more likely to develop it a younger age and women at an older age      Gender differences on dementia onset have been puzzling for decades, Schwarzinger said Men have a poorer lifestyle than women on average, in particular heavier alcohol consumption Therefore, it is somewhat unsurprising that early-onset dementia identifies a cluster of men with alcohol use disorders      The gender difference could also result from the study's methodology, according to Lyketsos      That was one of the reasons I'm a little concerned about selection bias, he said There could be a gender effect on who goes to the hospital with dementia      Alcohol use was also not objectively measured in the participants, one of the study's main limitations      We have no idea what is the level of drinks they were actually drinking, Schwarzinger added That kind of information you can only get in a cohort study with a questionnaire      Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter      Though the study had a very large sample size, it looked at individuals in only one country, making it difficult to generalize across cultures According to a 2014 report from the World Health Organization, each person consumes an average of 12.2 liters of pure alcohol in France versus 9.2 liters in the United States      But Schwarzinger cautioned that people outside France should still take the findings seriously: While the rate of alcohol use disorders is lower in the USA, it remains substantial enough to be considered major risk factor for dementia onset ", "summary": "The research, published in Lancet Public

{"article_number": 2215, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " Heavy drinkers are putting themselves at risk of dementia, according to the largest study of its kind ever conducted      Research published in the Lancet Public Health journal provides powerful evidence that people who drink enough to end up in hospital are putting themselves at serious risk of vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease It will also raise questions for moderate drinkers about the possible long-term consequences of their social habit      The study, which used the French National Hospital Discharge database, looked at more than a million people diagnosed with dementia between 2008 and 2013      Older people drinking too much could create NHS ‘timebomb’, says doctor Read more      More than a third – 38% of the 57,000 cases of early-onset dementia – were directly alcohol-related and 18% had an additional diagnosis of alcohol use disorders Overall, alcohol use disorders were associated with a three times greater risk of all types of dementia      Dr Sara Imarisio, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “As this study only looked at the people who had been admitted to hospital due to chronic heavy drinking, it doesn’t reveal the full extent of the link between alcohol use and dementia risk Previous research has indicated that even moderate drinking may have a negative impact on brain health and people shouldn’t be under the impression that only drinking to the point of hospitalisation carries a risk.”      Experts said the new research should change attitudes “What is most surprising about this paper is that it has taken us so long to recognise that alcohol misuse and dependence are such potent risk factors for the development of dementia,” said Robert Howard, professor of old age psychiatry at University College London            “We have long known that alcohol is directly neurotoxic, thiamine deficiency in alcoholics devastates memory, alcohol-related conditions such as cirrhosis and epilepsy can damage the brain and that vascular brain damage is accelerated by alcohol Surprisingly, we’ve not traditionally considered alcohol and its misuse as an important risk factor for dementia and we were clearly wrong not to have done so.”      Even moderate drinking can damage the brain, claim researchers Read more      The study was not set up to look at the effects of moderate drinking on people’s dementia risk But the lead author, Dr Michaël Schwarzinger of the Translational Health Economics Network in France, warned that the research showed damage done to the brain by alcohol is never repaired Heavy drinkers who had given up alcohol for a time did not reduce their dementia risk, even though they were less likely to die early “It is very striking that for people who were heavy drinkers and had at least a period of abstinence, the level of risk of dementia is about the same,” he told the Guardian      That is in line with imaging studies that have shown even moderate drinking has a permanent effect A study published in the British Medical Journal last year found that those who drank 14-21 units a week had three times the normal odds of damage to that part of the brain concerned with memory Guidance in the UK is not to drink more than 14 units a week      Advice on alcohol and dementia has been confusing Some studies have suggested that one or two units a day – perhaps a small glass of wine – could be protective But Schwarzinger said they were small studies and he personally would question whether that can be so            “Alcohol is a devastating problem, whatever the organ Now we can add the brain to the list of liver, kidney and heart,” he said      “A variety of measures are needed, such as reducing availability, increasing taxation, and banning advertising and marketing of alcohol, alongside early detection and treatment of alcohol use disorders.”      Prof Clive Ballard of the University of Exeter Medical School, UK, writing a commentary for the journal, said: “Their study is immensely important and highlights the potential of alcohol use disorders, and possibly alcohol consumption, as modifiable risk factors for dementia prevention … In our view, this evidence is robust and we should move forward with clear public health messages about the relationship between both alcohol use disorders and alcohol consumption, respectively, and dementia.”      Dr James Nicholls, director of policy and research development at Alcohol Research UK, said the concerns raised by the study were very serious “If heavy alcohol use increases the risk of dementia then there are enormous social and economic implications,” he said “We must recognise that good quality, widely accessible alcohol treatment has important long-term benefits, including reducing the levels of dementia in society And we must invest in these services, reversing the trend of recent years.” ", "summary": "– A new study suggests

These people simply were born in the wrong place, and that's why they're being punished for — their birthplace, said Park, who has founded a group help North Korean trafficking victims      The report was compiled by the Walk Free Foundation, an anti-slavery campaign founded by Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest, who said at the New York press conference that for the first time there is real hope we can end modern slavery      The goal of the index is to pressure governments and companies to do more to end modern slavery by providing hard data on the numbers of people involved and the impact it has around the world For example, modern slavery in developing nations puts jobs at risk in the U.S and Western Europe because domestic goods compete against imports produced through exploitation of the worst kind, Forrest told The Associated Press      By unraveling the trade flows and focusing on products at risk of modern slavery that are imported by the top economies, it becomes clear that even the wealthiest countries have a clear and immediate responsibility for responding to modern slavery both domestically and beyond their borders, the report said Developed economies are exposed to the risk of modern slavery not only when this crime is perpetrated within their national borders, but also when that risk is effectively transferred to them via the products they import      Modern slavery involves the use of threats, violence and deception to take away people's ability to control their own bodies, to refuse certain kinds of work or to stop working altogether      The report cites coal, cocoa, cotton, timber and fish as among the products that may be tainted by modern slavery      In North Korea, coal exports are the area of greatest concern      The index lists Eritrea, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Afghanistan, Mauritania, South Sudan, Pakistan, Cambodia and Iran as the worst offenders after North Korea      Repressive regimes are of particular concern because their populations are put to work to prop up the government, according to the report      ___      Associated Press writer Edith M Lederer at the United Nations

Hope isn't easily crushed | Penny Jaye Read more      The Global Slavery Index, published on Thursday by Walk Free Foundation, describes modern slavery as a complex and often hidden crime that crosses borders, sectors and jurisdictions The US number, the study estimates, is almost one hundredth of the estimated 40.3 million global total number of people it defines as being enslaved      “The United States is one of the most advanced countries in the world yet has more than 400,000 modern slaves working under forced labor conditions,” said the group’s founder, Andrew Forrest, in a news release      “This is a truly staggering statistic and demonstrates just how substantial this issue is globally This is only possible through a tolerance of exploitation,” Forrest added      The report estimates most victims of modern slavery live in Asia North Korea has the highest prevalence of modern slavery globally, with one in 10 of the population, or 2.6 million people, victims of modern slavery      A third, or 15 million, of victims of modern slavery enter through forced marriage, an issue that disproportionately affects women and girls “Overall, the cultural practice of forced marriage places women at greater risk of exploitation, and the potential subjection to a life of servitude, financial bondage and sexual exploitation that comes with modern slavery,” the report said      The report also argues the US figures are in themselves deceptive because the US exacerbates the global slavery problem by importing products, including laptops, computers, mobile phones, garments, fish, cocoa and timber, at risk of being produced through forced labor      The group recommends making forced marriage illegal, creating a minimum marriage age of 18, a national database of trafficking and forced labor cases, and working to improve supply-chain transparency to help bring the US numbers down      It estimates China is by far the largest source of at-risk goods, with the United States importing $122bn of electronics and clothing from the country Vietnam was the second largest source with $11.2bn, and India third with $3.8bn      Smaller values of goods were also sourced from Malaysia, Thailand, Brazil, Argentina, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Russia, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Peru      “There is no quick solution to this and governments, businesses, and consumers alike must wake up to the fact that they must change their behavior if they wish to tackle this abhorrent issue, both at home and abroad,” Forrest wrote      Walk Free’s methodology includes extrapolation using national surveys, databases of information of those who were assisted in trafficking cases, and reports from other agencies like the UN’s International Labour Organization      But other anti-exploitation groups offer caution over Walk Free’s definition of slavery and the methodology it uses in calculating the numbers of people affected      US criticises Ireland for insufficient action on modern slavery Read more      In a recent essay, What’s Wrong with the Global Slavery Index?, published in the Anti-Trafficking Review, the author, Anne Gallagher, argued that the term “modern slavery” seeks to encompass under its expansive umbrella a raft of exploitative practices and a myriad of victims      “We don’t yet have universally accepted diagnostic criteria or credible

{"article_number": 4207, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "COLUMBUS (WCMH) — A Columbus police officer fatally shot a 13-year-old boy he was trying to detain following reports of an armed robbery, officials said      Authorities identified the teenager as Tyre King, an 8th grader at Linden-McKinley STEM Academy The Columbus Division of Police said in a statement that King “pulled a gun from his waistband” when officers attempted to take him and another male into custody Wednesday night      This happened around 7:45pm near the corner of South 18th Street and East Capital Street      Columbus police responded to the area after a robbery victim claimed a group of individuals had robbed him at gunpoint Officers then spotted three males matching the description in front of 33 Hoffman Street and tried to talk to them      Two of the males then ran away, and officers followed them to an alley behind 27 Hoffman Street      “Officers followed the males to the alley … and attempted to take them into custody when one suspect pulled a gun from his waistband,” a police statement said “One officer shot and struck the suspect multiple times.”      King was taken to Nationwide Children’s Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 8:22 p.m No one else was injured      Crime Scene Search Unit detectives determined the teen was holding a BB gun with an attached laser sight      “We are talking about a 13-year-old that we believe was involved in an armed robbery,” CPD Chief Kim Jacobs said during a news conference “I know that some of the officers at the scene were very disturbed about the fact that here we are out at this time of the night chasing armed 13-year-olds.”      “We oughta be shocked and angry as a community In the safest big city in America, we have a 13-year-old dead in our city That’s unacceptable,” said Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther “We as a community need to come to grips with the fact, with such easy access to guns, whether they’re firearms or replicas, there’s something wrong in this country and it’s bringing its epidemic to our city streets.”      PHOTOS: Officer Involved Shooting Scene View as list View as gallery Open Gallery      According to police, the officer who fired the shots is Brian Mason, a nine-year veteran of the force who just recently transferred to the zone where Wednesday night’s shooting happened As with all police-involved shootings, the officers will receive “mandated psychological support counseling” and be given the opportunity to “take leave time to assist in recovery from a traumatic experience,” according to the Columbus Division of Police      “I will not let an officer out on the street to perform their job if I don’t trust them to be capable of doing so,” Jacobs said      King was last enrolled at Linden STEM Academy as an 8th grader There are grief counselors at the school today      In a statement released Thursday afternoon, King’s family said he was a typical 13-year-old child He was active in football, soccer, hockey and gymnastics They said the actions described by Columbus police are out of his normal character      The family of King retained Walton + Brown, LLP, a Columbus based civil rights law firm to “ensure that the investigation into his tragic death is conducted in a manner that ensures fairness and truth.”      In a statement, attorney Chanda L Brown said in a statement:      The family is obviously distraught by the murder of Tyre Our preliminary research indicates that Tyre was a child who was loved and cherished by his family The grief is worsened further by the fact that this death comes at the hands of a man who was sworn to protect the citizens of Columbus We love our city and there are many positive things than can be said about the people that live here However, the Columbus Police Department has a history of investigating itself following these officer involved shootings and we believe that these investigations are inherently biased The best thing that the City of Columbus could do to ease the minds and fears of its citizens is to step aside and let an independent party investigate the matter      Attorney Sean L Walton continued:      The family of Tyre King asks for support from their community as they seek answers in this tragic killing Please do not rush to judgment We also have to remind everyone that the “facts” being discussed in the media are not facts at all We do not know what he did or did not do There are allegations that have been made regarding his actions, and those allegations cannot be taken as factual until a thorough, unbiased investigation has taken place Please keep that in mind as we discuss the killing of this 13-year-old child There are multiple witnesses that we have been made aware of that do not corroborate the current narrative Please keep the family in your prayers and understand that until we have answers we must continue to call for transparency and accountability not only in all police involved killings, but especially in the case of this 13-year-old boy      Police say the officers involved were not wearing body cameras Last month, 30 Columbus cops began testing body-worn cameras and the department is expected to fully implement the devices by the end of the year      “It is a technology we believe can really help continue to improve and increase safety here in Columbus, and

still under investigation Evidence will go to a grand jury who will ultimate decide if there will be criminal charges      “A 13-year-old is dead in the city of Columbus because of our obsession with

resident Chris Naderer told The Columbus Dispatch he heard a gate in his backyard get knocked down and then saw police chasing two young men in an alley outside of his home      Heard gun shots, five, 10 seconds afterwards, Naderer also told NBC affiliate WCMH      Police respond to the officer-involved shooting of 13-year-old Tyre King in Columbus, Ohio, on Thursday WCMH-TV      As with all police-involved shootings, the officers will receive mandated psychological support counseling and be given the opportunity to take leave time to assist in recovery from a traumatic experience, according to Columbus police      The officer who fired the shots was later identified as Bryan Mason, a nine-year veteran of the force who just recently transferred to the zone where the incident happened He was being placed on paid administrative leave for about a week, said Columbus police Sgt Rich Weiner      Mason was previously involved in the fatal shooting of an armed man in 2012, reported the Dispatch Police determined he acted within policy      The family of the boy said in a statement that they want an independent investigation into the shooting      The Columbus Police Department has a history of investigating itself following these officer involved shootings and we believe that these investigations are inherently biased, attorney Chanda L Brown said The best thing that the City of Columbus could do to ease the minds and fears of its citizens is to step aside and let an independent party investigate the matter      13-year-old Tyre King, who police said was wanted for questioning in an armed robbery, ended up fatally shot by a police officer in Columbus, Ohio Courtesy of Walton and Brown, LLP      Jacobs said investigators are expected to pass their review of the latest case onto a prosecutor and grand jury, which would determine whether any criminal charges are warranted against the officers involved      It's unclear whether any surveillance or cellphone footage has been recovered showing the shooting      Police also did not immediately say whether the officers involved were wearing body cameras Last month, 30 Columbus cops began testing body-worn cameras and the department is expected to fully implement the devices by the end of the year, WCMH reported      You have to feel for the family in this and you also have to think about what the officer’s going through,” Weiner told reporters late Wednesday There’s no winners here      King was last enrolled at Linden STEM Academy as an eighth grader, WCMH said King’s family said in a statement released by their attorneys that “Tyre was a typical 13-year-old child He was active in football, soccer, hockey, and gymnastics      The city of Columbus has seen 13 police-involved shootings this year Five ended with a civilian being fatally shot, and one resulted in the death of the officer      The incident in Columbus comes almost two years after 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot dead by a police officer in Cleveland      Rice, a black sixth-grade student, was holding a pellet gun when the officer shot him within two seconds of arriving at the scene      His death sparked protests over policing and racial bias Last December, a grand jury chose not to indict the two officers involved In April, the city of Cleveland agreed to pay $6 million to settle a civil rights lawsuit brought by the Rice family      Jacobs said it's too early to compare the shootings of King and Rice, although they both involve young black children carrying BB guns being fatally shot by white officers      We don’t have enough facts to know anything how this relates to any other shooting, including Tamir Rice’s, Jacobs said That’s why we do an investigation      An attorney representing King’s family urged the public not to rush to judgment We do not know what he did or did not do There are allegations that have been made regarding his actions, and those allegations cannot be taken as factual until a thorough, unbiased investigation has taken place, attorney Sean L Walton said      Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther called for calm while the investigation continues, but he said the shooting raises concerns about access to weapons, including BB guns made to look like actual firearms      We as a community need to come to grips with the fact that with such easy access to guns — whether they're firearms or replicas — there’s something wrong with this country, Ginther said, and it's bringing this epidemic to our city streets ", "summary": "WCMH identifies the

{"article_number": 4368, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "At first confused for a wolf, this coywolf was trapped in northern Cheboygan County in July 2010 (Photo: Michigan Department of Natural Resources)      Phil Myers had heard the stories from Cheboygan County farmers: Tales of odd, oversized animals that looked bigger than a coyote, but smaller than a wolf, and hunted in packs — and how strange they sounded      He wanted to hear for himself      Wolves are known to have a rendezvous point where, in the evening, individual wolves that may be sleeping all over get together as a pack to go off hunting, said Myers, a now-retired professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Michigan Based at U-M's Biological Station in Cheboygan County, researchers had found dens, and what they thought was a rendezvous point      So, one night last August, Myers parked his pickup about a quarter-mile from the spot and listened      As the full moon goes up above the jackpines, one of these things starts howling — it wasn't the yipping of a coyote or the full voice of a wolf; but a hoarse, sustained call, he said      About five minutes later, I hear a bark from my right, then a bark from my left, five or six of them I was surrounded by them But this was in forest and swampland; these were no dogs Those were pack-mates coming into this rendezvous point      It was probably at least an hour before the hairs on the back of my neck sat down      Myers' close encounter was with a unique, still relatively unknown and misunderstood hybrid of coyotes known as eastern coyotes or coywolves They're mostly coyote, but contain a small percentage of wolf from an unlikely mating of the two species about a century ago It may sound like an urban legend, but coywolves exist throughout the northeastern U.S and eastern Canada, and have been confirmed in northeast Lower Michigan through blood-testing and DNA analysis      Buy Photo The coywolf, or Eastern coyote, is a slightly larger, hybrid coyote that includes a small percentage of wolf DNA (Photo: Detroit Free Press)      Coywolves tend to be a little larger and heavier than their western coyote counterparts, but still well below the size of even the smallest North American wolves They look like coyotes, though observers often note wolflike characteristics in their faces and fur      Though researchers have determined the range of coywolves — from the Great Lakes east and as far south as Virginia — their numbers and whether their behavior is distinctive from pure coyotes is still largely unknown      Cheboygan County farmer William Benthem hasn't seen them, but hears the stories from fellow farmers They believe they're seeing wolves, he said      I know too many people who are knowledgeable people who have seen them, he said      'Eastern coyotes'      Coyote expert Stan Gehrt, a professor of wildlife ecology at Ohio State University, rejects the term coywolf He doesn't even like referring to them as hybrids It leaves the impression that they are a near 50-50 mix of wolf and coyote, and that just isn't the case, he said      They are eastern coyotes, Gehrt said They aren't really different from other coyotes, other than they have a little bit of genetic difference I've trapped and tracked hundreds of Midwestern coyotes and a pretty good sample of eastern coyotes in Nova Scotia, and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the two      But those, including biologists, who encountered coywolves up close in the Lower Peninsula say they had some wolflike features      The animal was discovered in the Pellston and Cheboygan area in 2010, after reports of unusually large tracks in the snow, Michigan Department of Natural Resources wildlife biologist Jennifer Kleitch said      The DNR and the U.S Department of Agriculture became very interested, thinking wolves may have appeared in the Lower Peninsula, Myers said The last confirmed wolf south of the Mackinac Bridge was in Presque Isle County in 2004, but sightings have been reported since, and the DNR conducts surveys searching for wolves in the northern Lower Peninsula      Trail cameras were installed in 2010, and some of the photos coming back showed animals that were wolflike, Kleitch said A USDA wolf biologist trapped a male pup in July 2010 in Cheboygan County Blood tests were taken, and the pup was ear-tagged and released      Later that fall, a coyote trapper caught two half-grown animals, and noticing their difference from typical coyotes, contacted the DNR As in July, blood samples were drawn and the animals were fitted with radio collars      They wanted to see how they were moving, and whether they are a problem for the farmers up there, Myers said      Kleitch got to see the coywolves that were trapped in October up close She'd never seen anything like it      It was strange, she said The nose was a little narrow for a wolf, but the feet were large like a wolf They were the young of the year and they were females, and the weights on them were about 42 and 49 pounds — that's pretty large for even an adult female coyote      After tracking the animals' radio signals for several weeks, one of the collars began transmitting a mortality signal, Kleitch said It was later found cut off and thrown into a ditch We presume the animal was poached, she said      But the other animal is still followed, with the help of Myers' class at the U-M Biological Station, she said      Meanwhile, the genetic results came in on the three animals' blood tests      The animals were all from the same litter, and typed out as coyote rather than wolf, she said They also had DNA from eastern wolves, the tests showed      Interspecies breeding      Based on the relatively low percentage of wolf DNA in coywolves, many scientists say the interspecies breeding occurred in the early 1900s, likely in Ontario as western coyotes migrated east from the Great Plains Some split and headed north of the Great Lakes into Canada; others to the south around Ohio Based on coywolves' range now, it was a coyote in this northern group, perhaps having no mate of its own species available, that must have mated with a female eastern wolf It's known that the female in the coupling was a wolf, because the mitochondrial type of DNA exhibiting wolf characteristics is passed on by the female      The eastward-migrating coyotes that went north of the Great Lakes and interbred with wolves grew and spread in population much more quickly than those without wolf DNA to the south      Though highly unusual, coyotes, wolves and even dogs have been known to interbreed on occasion and produce viable offspring also capable of breeding      Wolves normally kill coyotes; they chase them out of the range, Myers said      But there is not a scientific consensus that the wolf-coyote coupling occurred long ago and not again A 2012 study of the blood results of the three captured coywolves in northern Michigan concluded their hybridization could have occurred in the Lower Peninsula if a recolonizing wolf encountered a coyote and mated with it in the absence of another wolf with which to breed      Researchers from the U-M biological station last year tracked radio-collared coywolves, and found their range slightly larger than a typical coyote's but less than a wolf's      OSU's Gehrt, however, is skeptical Even if coywolves are observed to hunt in packs and take down larger animals such as white-tailed deer, that's behavior in which conventional coyotes occasionally engage as well, he said The size of the range is more likely driven by the available food — eastern coyotes he has studied in Nova Scotia have taken down moose because of a lack of other food options, he said      The idea that the 5% wolf DNA is having this impact on their morphology and ecology should be held up to some rigorous testing, Gehrt said I think it would be more reasonable to presume it's just not going to have that much effect      Scientists still have a lot to learn about the animals, Gehrt said Among the areas ripe for study is whether the small percentage of wolf DNA will start working its way into western coyotes, or whether it will be diluted away, he said      No known attacks      Despite a belief that coywolves are more likely to take down a deer, Myers said he's not aware of any instances of farmers' cattle or sheep coming under attack in northeast Lower Michigan      Management and regulation of the animals could become complicated The hybrids — impossible to confirm without DNA tests — are simply treated as coyotes in Michigan      Coyotes can be hunted and trapped almost year-round, and wolves right now are endangered, so there's no take, Kleitch said It gets pretty sticky      We tell people that if it looks like a wolf, treat it like a wolf That means if coyote hunters or trappers think it could be a wolf, they should not harvest that animal      There are two camps of thinking on coywolves, Myers said      One is that hybridization is bad, because it dilutes the genotype of the two species that are hybridizing You'll eventually lose the wolf genotype and the coyote genotype, he said But other people feel like places like the Northern Lower haven't had an apex predator for close to 100 years The deer herd has gotten out of control — the deer hunters don't agree with that; they think that there aren't enough deer But the numbers, we know, are nowhere near where they were 100 to 150 years ago      You're always going to have one group of people who hate them, who have hated coyotes and were absolutely opposed to the growth of the wolf population And then you've got other people who think it's just kind of cool we're getting a more natural, more balanced ecosystem in the forests up there      The eastern coyotes are fascinating animals, Gehrt said      Indians used to call the coyote the trickster, and say it had the ability to change shapes, he said To me, this whole genetic thing is them getting back at us, and living up to their past label as tricksters      On the wolf — and coywolf — watch in northern Lower Michigan      The Michigan Department of Natural Resources is currently conducting a wolf survey in northern Lower Michigan, looking for public reports of wolf tracks or sightings Coywolf information is also welcome, DNR wildlife biologist Jennifer Kleitch said      We would appreciate getting reports of animals that show wolflike characteristics in the northern Lower Peninsula so we can determine how many and where animals like this may be, she said      Reports can be made online at http://www.michigandnr.com/wildlife/pubs/wolf_obsreport.asp or by calling the DNR's Gaylord office at 989-732-3541, ext 5901      Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/1BrULgn ", "summary": "The Economist reports this kind of interbreeding usually produces offspring that fail to thrive Bigger, stronger, and faster than the typical coyote, the coywolf is comfortable hunting in forests like a wolf as well as in open areas like a coyote One scientist who studied 437 coywolves found they contain 65% coyote DNA, 25% wolf DNA, and 10% dog DNA It's that dog DNA that is helping the coywolf thrive, even in urban areas like New York and Boston, the Economist reports They eat both produce and pets, look before crossing the street, and have even become nocturnal to adapt to urban living Their unique mix of genetics is allowing them to succeed where both wolves and coyotes have failed \"They are eastern coyotes,\" one coyote expert, who doesn't like the term coywolf, told the Detroit Free Press earlier this year \"They aren't really different from other coyotes.\" (This new type of rat has odd pubic hair.)", "summary_all": "– A potential new species—a coyote souped up with wolf and dog DNA that some are calling the \"coywolf\"—is spreading throughout eastern North America in a phenomenon the Economist says is \"astonishing.\" Scientists believe coywolves got their start a century or two ago when struggling wolf populations in Canada started breeding with dogs and coyotes The Economist reports this kind of interbreeding usually produces offspring that fail to thrive But the mix of wolf, dog, and coyote DNA proved to be an exception Bigger, stronger, and faster than the typical coyote, the coywolf is comfortable hunting in forests like a wolf as well as in open areas like a coyote One scientist who studied 437 coywolves found they contain 65% coyote DNA, 25% wolf DNA, and 10% dog DNA It's that dog DNA that is helping the coywolf thrive, even in urban areas like New York and Boston, the Economist reports Some scientists believe the dog DNA makes coywolves more tolerant of humans and noises They eat both produce and pets, look before crossing the street, and have even become nocturnal to adapt to urban living Their unique mix of genetics is allowing them to succeed where both wolves and coyotes have failed \"[It's an] amazing contemporary evolution story that's happening right underneath our nose,\" says one researcher, who estimates there are millions of coywolves in North America by this point But there is still debate about whether they are their own species \"They are eastern coyotes,\" one coyote expert, who doesn't like the term coywolf, told the Detroit Free Press earlier this year \"They aren't really different from other coyotes.\" (This new type of rat has odd pubic hair.)"}
{"article_number": 4368, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " LIKE some people who might rather not admit it, wolves faced with a scarcity of potential sexual partners are not beneath lowering their standards It was desperation of this sort, biologists reckon, that led dwindling wolf populations in southern Ontario to begin, a century or two ago, breeding widely with dogs and coyotes The clearance of forests for farming, together with the deliberate persecution which wolves often suffer at the hand of man, had made life tough for the species That same forest clearance, though, both permitted coyotes to spread from their prairie homeland into areas hitherto exclusively lupine, and brought the dogs that accompanied the farmers into the mix      Interbreeding between animal species usually leads to offspring less vigorous than either parent—if they survive at all But the combination of wolf, coyote and dog DNA that resulted from this reproductive necessity generated an exception The consequence has been booming numbers of an extraordinarily fit new animal (see picture) spreading through the eastern part of North America Some call this creature the eastern coyote Others, though, have dubbed it the “coywolf” Whatever name it goes by, Roland Kays of North Carolina State University, in Raleigh, reckons it now numbers in the millions      Upgrade your inbox Receive our Daily Dispatch and Editors' Picks newsletters                                          The mixing of genes that has created the coywolf has been more rapid, pervasive and transformational than many once thought Javier Monzón, who worked until recently at Stony Brook University in New York state (he is now at Pepperdine University, in California) studied the genetic make-up of 437 of the animals, in ten north-eastern states plus Ontario He worked out that, though coyote DNA dominates, a tenth of the average coywolf’s genetic material is dog and a quarter is wolf      The DNA from both wolves and dogs (the latter mostly large breeds, like Doberman Pinschers and German Shepherds), brings big advantages, says Dr Kays At 25kg or more, many coywolves have twice the heft of purebred coyotes With larger jaws, more muscle and faster legs, individual coywolves can take down small deer A pack of them can even kill a moose      Coyotes dislike hunting in forests Wolves prefer it Interbreeding has produced an animal skilled at catching prey in both open terrain and densely wooded areas, says Dr Kays And even their cries blend those of their ancestors The first part of a howl resembles a wolf’s (with a deep pitch), but this then turns into a higher-pitched, coyote-like yipping      The animal’s range has encompassed America’s entire north-east, urban areas included, for at least a decade, and is continuing to expand in the south-east following coywolves’ arrival there half a century ago This is astonishing Purebred coyotes never managed to establish themselves east of the prairies Wolves were killed off in eastern forests long ago But by combining their DNA, the two have given rise to an animal that is able to spread into a vast and otherwise uninhabitable territory Indeed, coywolves are now living even in large cities, like Boston, Washington and New York According to Chris Nagy of the Gotham Coyote Project, which studies them in New York, the Big Apple already has about 20, and numbers are rising      Even wilier      Some speculate that this adaptability to city life is because coywolves’ dog DNA has made them more tolerant of people and noise, perhaps counteracting the genetic material from wolves—an animal that dislikes humans And interbreeding may have helped coywolves urbanise in another way, too, by broadening the animals’ diet Having versatile tastes is handy for city living Coywolves eat pumpkins, watermelons and other garden produce, as well as discarded food They also eat rodents and other smallish mammals Many lawns and parks are kept clear of thick underbrush, so catching squirrels and pets is easy Cats are typically eaten skull and all, with clues left only in the droppings      Thanks to this bounty, an urban coywolf need occupy only half the territory it would require in the countryside And getting into town is easy Railways provide corridors that make the trip simple for animals as well as people      Surviving once there, though, requires a low profile As well as having small territories, coywolves have adjusted to city life by becoming nocturnal They have also learned the Highway Code, looking both ways before they cross a road Dr Kays marvels at this “amazing contemporary evolution story that’s happening right underneath our nose”      Whether the coywolf actually has evolved into a distinct species is debated Jonathan Way, who works in Massachusetts for the National Park Service, claims in a forthcoming paper that it has He thinks its morphological and genetic divergence from its ancestors is sufficient to qualify But many disagree One common definition of a species is a population that will not interbreed with outsiders Since coywolves continue to mate with dogs and wolves, the argument goes, they are therefore not a species But, given the way coywolves came into existence, that definition would mean wolves and coyotes should not be considered different species either—and that does not even begin to address whether domestic dogs are a species, or just an aberrant form of wolf      In reality, “species” is a concept invented by human beings And, as this argument shows, that concept is not clear-cut What the example of the coywolf does demonstrate, though, is that evolution is not the simple process of one species branching into many that the textbooks might have you believe Indeed, recent genetic research has discovered that even Homo sapiens is partly a product of hybridisation Modern Europeans carry Neanderthal genes, and modern East Asians the genes of a newly recognised type of early man called the Denisovans Exactly how this happened is unclear But maybe, as with the wolves of southern Ontario, it was the only way that some of the early settlers of those areas could get

North Carolina's campus Monday evening chanting for the removal of the monument and later blocking traffic in the Franklin Street area After dark, they removed it themselves, using a rope to bring the Confederate statue crashing down.The group initially gathered to call for university leaders to take action and remove the monument.But sometime after dark, a group used a rope and took matters into its own hands, toppling the statue amid wild cheers from the gathered crowd.Through a statement, Gov Roy Cooper said he shared the frustration felt by protesters but condemned the desecration of public property.Governor Cooper has been in contact with local law enforcement and UNC officials regarding tonight's rally and appreciates their efforts to keep people safe, said Cooper's spokesman,

criminal charges for covering Silent Sam with paint and her own blood earlier this year.Many students used large signs and banners to cover the statue.Protesters then moved up Franklin Street and were blocking traffic Chapel Hill Police said Franklin Street is closed between Raleigh Street and Church Street It reopened about 9:15 p.m., police said.At some point after that, the statue was brought to

restaurant Friday afternoon in downtown Ithaca By 7:45 a.m Saturday, the truck was removed from the building and East State Street was reopened North Aurora Street was closed and fenced off from the Commons to The Mahogany Grill Restaurants on the east side of Aurora Street were not affected The driver of the truck sustained superficial injuries and was being questioned at Ithaca police headquarters, police said Friday The cause of the crash and whether speed was a factor were being investigated Lindsey Pou, 26, a pastry chef at nearby Madeline’s Restaurant, said she was sitting outside on The Commons when she saw the tractor-trailer barreling down East State Street and smash into the building She said the driver did not sound the horn, and she did not hear any screeching brakes There were a number of diners sitting in the restaurant, and more Simeon’s employees were arriving for the evening shift when the accident occurred, she said A group of construction workers renovating The Commons were standing in the truck’s path and had to leap out of the way to avoid being hit, according to Pou “Everyone screamed A lot of people ran to try and help, to see what they could do,” she said “The response time for the police was really quick, which was awesome They took hold of the situation.” Police evacuated the 100 block of North Aurora Street and the 200 block of East State-MLK Street, according to Ithaca Police Department Public Information Officer Jamie Williamson A small fire started in the bar area of Simeon’s immediately after the collision but was extinguished The city engineer’s office as well as an outside engineering firm were evaluating the building After the truck collided with the restaurant, the building’s front corner collapsed, leaving a gaping hole in the apartments above Simeon’s Ithaca Mayor Svante Myrick said the occupants of the apartments were not home at the time of the collision      (Page 2 of 3)      Myrick advised people to avoid the east end of The Commons for the time being “There is some risk of the building collapsing,” he said “We did bring in a crane We have our building inspectors on the scene They are going to tell us what we need to do to the building to keep it stable We want to save the building if we can It’s beautiful land, it’s historic, but safety is our number one priority right now If we feel that the building is going to collapse, we will take it down ourselves.” Late Friday evening, a crane tore a section off the four-story building’s roof Tow trucks were on the scene to remove the car carrier Williamson said four injured people had been transported to Cayuga Medical Center with an additional person possibly arriving on their own A hospital spokesperson said seven injured people had been admitted None of the injuries was considered life-threatening, they said The names of the person killed and of the driver were not immediately released Previous accidents Pou noted that the particular location has a history of such accidents In September 2010, a dump truck headed down the State-Martin Luther King Street hill and hit the Community School of Music and Art building at Seneca Way Only the driver was hurt Authorities said he apparently lost control of the gravel-laden truck, which then rolled over and hit parked cars, then the building The driver was pinned but extricated within 15 minutes The building was evacuated and closed until damages were repaired and it was confirmed safe In 2008, police suspected brake failure when a northbound car headed down South Hill on Aurora Street and hit a parked delivery truck in the 100 block of the street The driver and four children riding with her were hospitalized “I don’t want to say this frequently happens, but this isn’t the first time we’ve had a horrible accident of this magnitude here,” Pou said Myrick said tractor-trailers are allowed on East State-Martin Luther King Jr Street, given that it is a state

{"article_number": 2874, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "In junior high school and elementary school, one of the worst things somebody can tell you is that you’re a nerd In many cases, being labeled a nerd is the kiss of death By being designated a nerd or a geek, your social circle instantly shrink Your social prospects, as well as how people relate to you change overnight The good news is that as socially limiting and potentially problematic being nerdy may be in elementary school, junior high school or even high school, the reality is that nerds run the world If you want to get a good idea of nerds that shaped the world in profound ways, you only need to look at Bill Gates and the people that invented the internet These are guys that would just hangout in their cubicles and work on computer codes for several hours at a time Growing up, they were very socially awkward and they tend to be focused on a limited range of interests The reason nerds run the world, whether in the world of finance, software, technology, even policy is because being nerdy enables them a kind of freedom that helps them transcend social boundaries Here are some key reasons why it’s good to be nerdy      Nerds Aren’t Limited By Social Expectations      In elementary school, junior high and high school, the conception of a “normal” or “average” person is somebody with a strong sense of social interaction Social skills are crucial for popularity Social skills are non-negotiable when it comes to being considered as part of the “in crowd” or “acceptable crowd” in any American elementary school, junior high school or high school In fact, the stereotype of a socially perfect student is somebody who has a fine balance between athletics and social skills Running against the grain of course is the nerd The nerd doesn’t have to operate by these rules The nerd is by definition outside of these rules He is the outsider He’s the outcast As socially painful as this outsider status may seem, it also comes with a certain sense of liberation If you are not going to be limited by expectations, then you have a lot more freedom You can explore different interests You can explore music and art and crafts and hobbies that aren’t “cool” or “normal” These explorations can help you get in touch with your emotional core It can help you celebrate aspects of yourself that might not be popular or looked upon favorably, but there’s a part of you as an individual There’s a certain joy in being free from expectations There’s a certain self-satisfaction that one can get by not having to play the same rules as everybody else      Nerds Can Focus and Go As Deep As They Want      One of the biggest hassles with a social conditioning is that your interest by definition is being limited You have to go about doing things the normal way You have to go about doing things the conventional way By going against the grain and truly exploring your individual interests, you can focus on interests that few people are focusing on and you can go as deep as you want This can produce a deep sense of personal satisfaction This also produces a deep sense of mastery In a very real sense, living in a conventional life really is embodying the old saying of Jack of all trades, master of none The whole concept of the “balanced” personality is that you really can’t become too good at any one thing because your main focus is to be “balanced” Nerds are free from all that They can focus only at a tight range of interests and go as deep as they want There’s a lot to be said about the deep sense of satisfaction you get when you truly master a subject matter or master a particular body of knowledge      Being Nerdy Allows You to Break Out Of the Herd      One of the biggest ironies of American culture is that, Americans love to think of themselves as individuals After all, the American experiment is based on the idea of personal freedom and individual liberty A key part of this of course is following your own drummer and following your own destiny This is the great American mythology As much as they like to praise the whole concept of individual personhood and individuality, the reality of American society is conformity This is why Americans are very big on consumer culture A consumer is driven by keeping up with the Joneses A consumer is driven by buying stuff and buying into lifestyle Not because you enjoy it, not because you believe in it, but because everybody else is doing it In short, the whole concept of conventional and acceptable middle-class lifestyle is really an exercise in conformity As we found out the hard way with the recent financial crash of 2008, this has serious consequences for Americans You cannot live your life spending money you don’t have trying to please people you don’t like and this is all driven by conformity Nerds are free from all this They are basically outcasts of the herd Being outcasts, they have the freedom to do and think in such a way that they are not restricted by this endless cycle of consumerism and conformity that often leads to financial stress, foreclosures, bankruptcy and midlife crises In a very real sense, nerds are free from the internal contradiction that makes modern American consumer culture so frustrating to free-thinkers      Being Nerdy Allows You to Explore Worlds of Ideas      When you look at individuals that truly changed the world, it’s very hard to make the argument that they are conformists When you look at really profound thinkers that changed how we look at society, how we look at our relationship with nature and how we look at our relationship with each other, you cannot really say that these people lived their lives in a conformist way In fact, if you want to truly change the world and if you want to truly make an impact, you have to step out of the row This makes all the logical sense in the world Seriously How can you bring about change when you are preaching ideas that are in conformity with the way things are being done? A truly earth shattering developments and pioneering ideas are based inherently on thinking patterns and personalities that step out of the ordinary and step out of the average The only thing you would get from people who think in average and conventional ways is a continuation of the status cowl This is hardly revolutionary      Take a look at the life of Benjamin Franklin Benjamin Franklin was a key thinker behind the American independence movement He did not think in conventional terms His ideas often run contrary to conventional wisdom But we celebrate him now because he was able to dictate the future of the United States through his unconventional ideas The whole idea of individual liberty being God-given instead of state-given was a revolutionary idea The whole idea that people own themselves is a hurdle Nerds are in the same philosophical tradition because since they are freed from the expectations of going with the grain and being part of the herd, they are given opportunities to truly think a new or unconventional ideas that may move the world forward The world of ideas by necessity is not a world of convention It’s not an exercise in improving things that are greed upon or the status cowl If anything, a truly innovated thinking is all about disruption When you look at the biographies of people behind the internet, this nerd factor comes up again and again It’s not conventional thinking that pushes the world forward It is thinking that is divorced from the requirements of conventional thinking and conformity      Being a Nerd Enables You to Reinvent Yourself… Many Times Over      One of the biggest challenges of human existence is transcendence When we are born, our primary concern was of course security, feeding ourselves, meeting our sex drive In other words, basic needs Unfortunately, the vast majority of people never get this past basic level of personal evolution The highest point of human evolution is self-actualization When you are able to transcend yourself and care about other people in a profound and absolute level I’m not talking about caring about family members or caring about your close circle of friends In some way, these people are just reflections of yourself or extensions of yourself due to biological bases I am talking about something in much more profound and wider I am talking about spiritual enlightenment Put a frame in secular terms Very few people achieve this The biggest obstacle of course is selfishness and being self-absorbed Being a nerd gives you a great opportunity to use your freedom from conventionality to allow you to reinvent yourself many times over A key part of reinvention of course is to question you old identity and your old assumptions and your old expectations This can really do wonders in moving the ball forward in coming up with new expectations and new assumptions that allow you to look at the world in a profoundly new way When you look at the world in a profoundly new way, you eventually change Scientific research has already established that our outer world is a reflection of our inner world Nerds have this great opportunity to reinvent themselves by changing the way they think and as a result, changing their practical reality      Nerdiness Puts You in a Position to Surprise      It is not surprising that nerds in their 30′s and 40′s often end up with very attractive women It happens time and time again The cynical way to look at this situation of course is that these nerds focused on building technology companies or being part of the founding employees that help propel a start-up that either went IPO or got bought out for several million dollars But putting finances aside although that is a key consideration, we still grapple with the fact that there are many nerds that still managed to get the girl even though they didn’t go through an IPO or they didn’t have a massive windfall What explains this situation? This situation of course that women tend to change overtime Nerdiness enables these guys to offer an alternative to the standard conventionality that many women find themselves rebelling against, especially once they enter their 20′s and 30′s There is a certain excitement and novelty with the nerd personality that you don’t get with somebody who consciously and deliberately tries to be average and conventional There is a sense of freedom and sense of possibility that you get with somebody that is always been outside of the confines of standard American convention ", "summary": "Her bottom line: “If you think that me allowing my son to be a female character for Halloween is somehow going to ‘make’ him gay then you are an idiot.” “Firstly, what a ridiculous concept,” she continues", "summary_all": "– A “mommy blogger” made quite an Internet stir with a recent post defending her 5-year-old son’s decision to cross-dress on Halloween She recounts how, when he showed up at his church pre-school dressed as Daphne from Scooby Doo, a group of mothers immediately “went wide-eyed and made faces as if they smelled decomp,” then made sure to air their “concerns” to her Her bottom line: “If you think that me allowing my son to be a female character for Halloween is somehow going to ‘make’ him gay then you are an idiot.” “Firstly, what a ridiculous concept,” she continues “Secondly, if my son is gay, OK I will love him no less Thirdly, I am not worried that your son will grow up to be an actual ninja so back off.” She’s gotten quite a bit of support, but the post also spurred controversy—partially because she titled it “My Son Is Gay,” even though “the post really isn’t about gayness per se,” writes Richard Lawson on Gawker “Her critics say that she's too early, and maybe too giddily, assigning labels that really don't have any weight when your child is so young.” Click here to read a similar essay by a dad."}

{"article_number": 5611, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "I recently got to know Las Cruces resident Todd Lawson LaTourrette, an actor of stage, film and TV He is also the published author of two books      His new book, Consumed, is a stand-out, because it takes mental illness out of the shadows into the clear light of day in a brutally honest manner      I’ve never seen the story of mental illness told as clearly, as poignantly, whether here in New Mexico or to a wider audience nationally Many families are seeking stronger advocacy to help affected loved ones, and the book serves as a good example of that      Isn’t that right, Todd:      “I am bipolar, type I I can presently divulge that I am mentally ill, have written my memoir (describing such, with strength, and dignity), and survived the discourse of a fragile existence It is a daily process, dependent upon self-realization, self-preservation, and overcoming the stigma of mental illness, with which we must treat every day with medications…      Consumed tells a compelling story of submitting to, then rising above, the mood swings, and the manic highs and life-threatening lows common to the illness, including suicidal ideations, followed by suicide attempts, and subsequent institutionalizations      Todd, tell us about the book’s title      “Consumed is the very term which fully describes what occurred in my past, due to my inability to properly care for my bipolar disorder My conscious decision to discontinue any medications, throughout my career with mental illness, truly consumed my entire being through the endless ruminations of my many self-destructive years.”      In writing the memoir, Todd, you realized your credibility is tied to your continuous treatment and medication…If you were to stop your med’s and lose the balance you have restored to your life, the book would be meaningless      Dedication to the care for oneself is the key      “My commitment to caring is first and foremost in my present life My number-one job is to take my medications every morning Moreover, the refinement of the dosages is critical I strike this balance by working with my psychiatrist, who is very knowledgeable, on a regular basis.”      “My goal and hope is to prevent future self-destructive behaviors and drastic mood swings.”      Today, Todd, you are vying for and landing roles for TV productions in Albuquerque You did a recent book signing in Santa Fe You have begun to reprise your earlier career, which included acting, singing and dancing stints in a New York national tour and aboard cruise ships      “My career on screen began in 1999, when upon I was cast in my first speaking role “Presently, I am very fortunate to have gained the respect of three main casting directors in Albuquerque, all of whom have booked me in major motion pictures and television Most notable, I was cast in ‘the Men who Stare at goats’ ( I was honored to work with Ewan McGregor, and even had the distinct pleasure of choking him on camera.”)      “Another major picture that I was cast in was as a Tradesman in Denzel Washington’s ‘The Book of Eli.’ This was a completely different experience than my previous successes You see, I decided to discontinue my prescribed medications, prior to shooting, but was fired before my contract ended My mood swings were intolerable, and thus the directors, the Hughes Brothers, pulled me, and my part from the final edit I lost credibility with casting directors and my talent agent I was not cast again for several years afterward.”      “In 2013, my television career gained momentum, and I was cast in 5 different TV series.”      [I’m speaking with Todd Lawson LaTourrette, author of Consumed, a first-hand account of his bipolar disorder.]      The fact that you could revive your career and find a fresh start by rising above day-to-day struggles, then capture and relate them in a crisp, prosaic way, speaks volumes about your will to seek change for the better You wrote the book in a style which makes it possible to read the whole memoir in one sitting I know I did      “The process of writing Consumed was lengthy It was seven years of writing and editing, then more writing and editing It was incredibly trying However, the healing process was truly necessary My hope now that it’s published is that it will assist others, by revealing the challenges/obstacles of mental health, gaining a diagnosis (should the reader recognize such behaviors within themselves, a dear friend, or loved one), and creating an effective treatment plan.”      Todd is becoming a spokesperson for a disease that is often under-recognized, wrongly categorized, or misunderstood The book is noteworthy, because health care advocacy often centers on illnesses like cancer, heart disease or Alzheimer’s, but not so much on mental health and behavioral psychoses      The disorder is more widespread in society than most of us realize      As the former spouse of a person with bipolar disorder, I know from first-hand experience in attempting to advocate for treatment and recovery, it is at least as insidious as cancer, destroying marriages, families, friendships, careers, savings, and so much more      “…very true Richard My relationships with friends has always been strained, when un-medicated My careers were constantly strained, due to my debilitating mood swings Further, I possessed many varying jobs…from performing, to an attempted career with the United States Army My depressive moods often caused a drastic change in professions When manic, I spent great amounts of money (credit cards), or behaved very erratically.”      “My greatest blessing in my life is my family…my support system; namely my very loving, self-sacrificial, and forgiving parents I would, most assuredly, not be sitting with you today Richard, if it were not for my extremely giving, and dedicated loved ones Many mentally ill people are not as fortunate as I There are a great amount of homeless persons suffering from a mental illness, and thusly they are undiagnosed…without any type of treatment, or support I am truly blessed.”      Consumed is a book that brings mental health advocacy to a new level In a direct, self-effacing but progressive way, it sets an example for thousands of other bipolar people, their families and friends      Yet, Todd, as you prove, it’s not hopeless if you have the strength and will to strike back, to escape from what you call a world of “nothingness, circumventing the unsteady bridge between stability and instability.”      “…interesting change in wording here, Richard The back cover of my memoir states ‘circumventing the unsteady bridge between sanity and insanity’ My mother and I have talked about those terms ‘sanity and insanity’, at great length We both are of the belief that these sentiments do NOT fully describe/are improperly used, regarding mental illness That is exactly why I have now phrased such as ‘stability and instability’ A more accurate result is of undiagnosed and un-medicated periods of one’s life…not a permanent state of mind.”      “As I have already stated, and will continue to do so, should a person read ‘Consumed’, and witness, through my own Journey, any signs that they may be mentally ill…then do please seek assistance with a diagnoses, and continuous treatment with prescribed medication[s] Help is available Life should be free of inner-confliction/ruminations, and filled with hope for a brighter future I truly hope my memoir causes just one person to take steps in the direction of mental health…my hopes will be fully fulfilled, should others deem ‘Consumed’ as helpful, even life-affirming.”      “Thank you Richard I am honored.”      Todd Lawson LaTourrette, this New Mexico actor, tells the vivid story of his bipolar disorder in his new book, Consumed, published by Pegasus, and available on Amazon in paperback

{"article_number": 5616, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "Hours and hours after Chloe Dykstra implied that Chris Hardwick sexually assaulted her while they were involved, the Talking Dead host has strongly denied the claims of his former girlfriend      “These are very serious allegations and not to be taken lightly which is why I’ve taken the day to consider how to respond,” said Hardwick in a statement Friday night “I was heartbroken to read Chloe’s post Our three year relationship was not perfect—we were ultimately not a good match and argued—even shouted at each other—but I loved her, and did my best to uplift and support her as a partner and companion in any way and at no time did I sexually assault her.”      Hardwick went on to detail the circumstances of their eventual separation, seemingly quote from Dykstra and how he was “blindsided” by her online account earlier today      “When we were living together, I found out that Chloe had cheated on me, and I ended the relationship,” Hardwick asserts “For several weeks after we broke up, she asked to get back together with me and even told me she wanted to have kids with me, ‘build a life’ with me and told me that I was ‘the one,’ but I did not want to be with someone who was unfaithful,” he added in the carefully crafted response “I’m devastated to read that she is now accusing me of conduct that did not occur l was blindsided by her post and always wanted the best for her As a husband, a son, and future father, I do not condone any kind of mistreatment of women.”      The response from the long time AMC host and Nerdist founder came late in the day after ex-girlfriend Dykstra wrote a harrowing first-person account of their three-year relationship online      While never calling out Hardwick directly by name, the Web TV personality and cast member of Syfy’s Heroes of Cosplay‘s post on Medium had numerous details about the “mildly successful podcaster” who became “a powerhouse CEO of his own company,

claims is conducted The cabler and home of The Walking Dead has remained silent on the matter but sources tell Deadline that execs have been mulling over the pleas of reps of Talking guests to address the situation      Set to play a big presence next month at San Diego Comic-Con, as he has in past years, there is no word if Hardwick will still moderate the inaugural panel of first female Doctor Who Jodie Whittaker or the Hall H return of The Walking Dead      In her essay this morning, Dykstra outlined a relationship that had restrictions placed on her going out at night, having male friends or speaking in public Most damning it also claimed that she was the victim of sexual and emotional assault by the unnamed ex-boyfriend      Dykstra also alleged that after she broke up with him, Hardwick and a female colleague successfully worked to have her blacklisted from the industry, calling companies she had been employed by “to get me fired by threatening to never work with them.”      Additionally, Dykstra also took to Twitter on her claims and the response she had received:      I quietly posted an article today, unlisted on Medium It clearly made the rounds I’m overwhelmed and I

Over the years, I’ve attempted to write this, quite literally, 17 times I’ve spoken to friends, therapists, lawyers, publicists The drafts have ranged from cathartic, angry letters to litigious, hardened accounts of inexcusable treatment Until I got one piece of advice from a friend: Write from your heart You’ll know it’s right when it’s right So, here I go      I’ve struggled with such a great fear of talking publicly about my experience with long-term abuse There’s an explicit danger- putting my personal and professional reputation on the line      It’s so easy to make judgments about someone you don’t know personally, or maybe do know personally, but not well It’s the same both ways “Did they, didn’t they?” I’m here to tell my story, not necessarily intending to point my finger at the man who did it (though that may be an unfortunate consequence for him), but for a different reason      Admittedly, there’s still an anger inside of me An anger at him, an anger at myself for letting myself fall into the trap and being naïve enough to stay there But after hours and hours of thought, I‘ve finally come to the conclusion of what I want this to be      I want this to be two things Number One: Closure I’m approaching my thirties, finding stability, and quite simply, I want this out of me But more importantly, Number Two: A warning      Emotional abuse is a very common thing More common than you’d think      Here is my story      In my early twenties, I was a vibrant, goofy kid who loved video games, Doctor Who, dressing up in cosplay with my friends, and karaoke nights One day, I met someone at a convention and ended up falling for a man almost 20 years my senior It wasn’t the first time I’d found myself in a relationship with an older man; I’ve always joked about my daddy issues, and thought that with age came stability and wisdom Welp      Our relationship started out poorly Within 2 weeks, rules were quickly established Some of these included:      I “should not want to go somewhere at night” My nights were expected to be reserved for him, as he had a busy schedule This alienated me from my friends I was to not have close male friends unless we worked together All photos of male friends were to be removed from my apartment This was heartbreaking for me, as my best friend happened to be male As he was sober, I was not to drink alcohol Before we began dating he said, “I noticed you have a glass of wine with dinner That’s going to stop.” I was not to speak in public places (elevators, cars with drivers, restaurants where tables were too close) as he believed that people recognized him and were listening to our conversations Our dinners out were usually silent, him on his phone I wasn’t allowed to take a photo of us (Eventually, he softened on this rule, but was very stern about me asking permission.)      These were just a few of them And I made the choice to accept his controlling behavior, as he’d just left his long-term girlfriend and I assumed that he was going through some serious emotional discomfort This was a huge mistake      Our first convention together, San Diego Comic Con, he instructed me to not leave the hotel room He went to parties by himself and got a famous actress’s number with intention to date her at the same time as me I found out months later, and couldn’t bring myself to say anything because by this time, my self-worth was in the toilet      I was quickly pressured to take an on-camera job at his company I didn’t want (I do not like to work for my significant others), because he insinuated I would be ungrateful to not accept it Scared to upset him, I accepted the job, but I refused payment for my work, feeling uncomfortable about the whole thing (though the lovely folks at his company eventually forced me to take a check) By this time, like I said, I was terrified to piss him off- so I did what he said      …Including let him sexually assault me Regularly I was expected to be ready for him when he came home from work      How did this happen? At the beginning of our relationship, I was quite ill often due to my diet, something I’ll get to in a bit One night he initiated, and I said, “I’m so sorry, can we not tonight? I’m feeling really sick.” He responded, “I just want to remind you, the reason my last relationship didn’t work out was because of the lack of sex.” It was a veiled threat I succumbed      Every night, I laid there for him, occasionally in tears He called it “starfishing” He thought the whole idea was funny To be fair, I did go along with it out of fear of losing him I’m still recovering from being sexually used (not in a super fun way) for three years      The first time I told him I loved him after 6 months of hoping he’d say it first, his response was (and I quote), “I think I love you too, f****t.”      What I wanted was a partner, someone to confide in, someone to share things with, someone who wouldn’t judge me, someone I knew would be there for me What I felt that this man wanted was a woman who would feed him, sleep with him, and go to events with him      I watched and supported him as he grew from a mildly successful podcaster to a powerhouse CEO of his own company He was obsessed with celebrity, being famous, famous people He did not spend any time with people he considered “friends”, and only really made time for industry people who he considered “worth it” I, myself, had very little personal support, as I’d been alienated from my own friends, other than an occasional party I was obligated to leave early when he decided it was time Sometimes he’d let me go play D&D, but I always had a curfew He would yell in his voicemails at me if I didn’t answer his calls I was expected to follow him everywhere and exist pretty much solely for him, save for a hosting job once in awhile      When cameras were on us? He was a prince Turn them off, he was a nightmare      One of my “progress” shots      During all of this I lost myself, both mentally and physically I lost 15 lbs within weeks, started pulling out my hair (and had to get extensions regularly to hide it) I generally stopped speaking unless spoken to while with him, drifting through life like a ghost I would try to sleep in as late as possible so my days were shorter I stopped listening to music entirely I ceased to be I was an ex-person      No one could save me but myself After three years of being snapped/yelled at constantly, very rarely being shown any affection- I finally left him For another man That I had literally just met I was so desperate to be out I just clung on to the first knight in shining armor to show up      Unfortunately, there was a slight crossover: a kiss A kiss I immediately told him about, and he, surprisingly, instantly forgave me Turned a total 180 He begged me not to leave him, even told me he was planning to propose; despite stating previously he had no intention to marry me I knew this all stemmed from his fear of being alone (He actually got engaged very shortly after I left him) so luckily I remained strong in my resolve to leave him, despite my only desire for three years being that he loved me the way I loved him      Because of my leaving him for someone else, he made calls to several companies I received regular work from to get me fired by threatening to never work with them He succeeded I was blacklisted With the assistance of a woman who’d gained my trust and my heart over the past year, he steamrolled my career The woman actively made it her mission to destroy my friendships And she did, because by the time they’d realized she was… an unreliable source… the damage had already been done To be fair, in break-ups like this one, some friends will just naturally gravitate towards the person who wields more power (and the ability to employ them), especially in the business I’m in- despite whatever history exists Still, there’s so much more to that woman’s story (including 6 other women whose reputations/careers she attempted to sabotage) but I don’t want to digress too far from my point, which is abusive relationships, not friendships This time in my life was agony      One night, I found myself on top of an overpass, looking down at the 101, at the lowest point in my life I’d lost many of my friends, the woman I’d considered my sister was trying to destroy me and I had no idea why, and the career I’d built from scratch had toppled- I was blacklisted from my industry at the age of 25      Obviously, I didn’t go through with it, but over the years I considered it many times With the help of a therapist, a psychiatrist, good people, plus a lot of hard work, I’ve managed to rebuild my life and I’m in a much better place I’ve got a wonderful group of friends, a healthy career, a film I’m proud of, a show I’m proud of, two wonderful dogs, a house I own, and a bright future (at least, in my eyes)      But I never received closure For the long-lasting trauma, physical and emotional For the time I was screamed at for spilling some bottled water in a rental car For the time I asked him if he “was okay” one too many times For the time I gasped at a cute puppy and I was punished for startling him For how cold and unkind he was to me 90% of the time For losing the life and friendships I’d built because of his insecurities For blaming me for leaving him when he was never there in the first place, except when he wanted sex      I’ll leave you with this: I lost my period for a year because of anorexia Somehow, I got pregnant ectopically (I was told I’d have to have surgery IMMEDIATELY because ectopic pregnancies are very dangerous and can often be fatal)- when I found out, I collapsed on the floor, terrified he would be furious with me Between sobs I told him over the phone, “Please don’t be mad, and don’t worry, I have to have surgery to have it removed or it could kill me at any time.”      My fear of his anger at me for getting pregnant was literally greater than my fear of death      Let me add here: I’ll never forget the night this man slept in a cot at the foot of my hospital bed after my surgery It made me believe that deep down inside of him maybe there was a man who loved me      Then, after my recovery, he and my mother were greeted by the doctor      “The surgery went well, she’ll be fine,” said my doctor      “Thank god,” said my mother      “That’s great When do you think I can have sex with her again?” said my ex      It was his first question My mother never forgot      While we were together, he repeatedly shared with me that he was terrified I would talk publicly about how he treated me, but I’m done protecting him at the expense of my own mental health He talked about me publicly, incorrectly speculating loudly and regularly that I was sleeping around on him, on multiple occasions (once in front of an audience of thousands at a convention) It got so bad I ended up having to ask my lawyer to write his a letter Meanwhile, publicly, I continually tried to go high while he went low Also at the time, I knew it was unlikely people would choose to believe me over a cheery-sounding famous guy All it would do to properly come forward was hurt me And guess what? It will probably hurt me now too, despite the #MeToo movement We’ve come a long way, but we still have a ways to go      You know, perhaps this post could be construed as me going low when I should be going high, but I’d like to think Michelle Obama would support me in this… Because I’m not alone This kind of relationship is so common, and so easy to slip into Normalizing behavior happens incredibly quickly, and one can lose track of what is acceptable treatment      And that’s the big question, isn’t it? If this person treated you so badly why did you stay?      Your guesses will probably include:      It wasn’t that bad Memories can warp He was famous She enjoyed the lifestyle (For the record, I usually insisted on paying for dinner, thank you very much.) She was dumb and/or weak and didn’t have the strength to stand up to him      Here is my answer: I believed that, to borrow an analogy from a friend, if I kept digging I would find water And sometimes I did Just enough to sustain me And when you’re dying of thirst, that water is the best water you’ll ever drink When you’re alienated from your friends, there’s no one to tell you that there’s a drinking fountain 20 feet away And when your self-worth reaches such depths after years of being treated like you’re worthless, you might find you think you deserve that sort of treatment, and no one else will love you      This story, post, whatever this is, serves as both closure for me as I say farewell to my twenties and stumble my way into my thirties, and it serves as a warning for every single one of you, regardless of gender One of my favorite quotes comes from Bojack Horseman:      “You know, it’s funny; when you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags.”      Please, please, keep an eye out for those red flags      Signed,      Former Trophy Girlfriend/Ghost — Chloe Dykstra      PS: To the man who tried to ruin my future: A sincere and heartfelt apology could have made my last four years a hell of a lot easier The person I used to date would try to sue me due to pride- I would not recommend it I have audio/video that will support and prove many of the things I’ve stated in this post I’ve chosen not to include it for your sake, in the hopes that the person you’ve become will do the right thing      (July 7th) EDIT to address the change in my essay:      I had kept the words “sexually assault” in my piece since the very first draft Before posting, I got cold feet and was pressured to change it to “sexually violate” out of fear of backlash When it posted unlisted, the edit did not save- and I’m grateful it didn’t, because it did not allow me to back away from my original statement When I decided to “publish” it properly (make it “listed” instead of unlisted), it changed the words back to “sexually violate” I immediately went to rectify it as quickly as I could I stand by my statement ", "summary": "\"He called it 'starfishing.'

{"article_number": 2309, "article_idx": 3, "article_text": " It’s finally here! Last night, Queen Adele dropped “Hello,” the debut single from the singer’s forthcoming album 25, and her first new track since she was commissioned to write the theme for the 2012 James Bond flick Skyfall There has been a lot of hype for this record—it’s a follow-up to 2011’s Grammy-sweeping 21, which also happens to be the highest-selling album of the past decade—without much more than a list of rumored collaborators to show for it (Back in August, Billboard reported that Danger Mouse, Max Martin, Tobias Jesso Jr and “Rumour Has It” songwriter Ryan Tedder had worked on new music with Adele; that story and a few online teases was all that fans had to go on.) But it’s real! In an open letter posted on Twitter earlier this week, the British songwriter apologized for the delay—she’s now 27, for what it’s worth—and described the emotional thrust behind the record:      Advertisement      My last record was a break-up record and if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record I’m making up with myself Making up for lost time Making up for everything I ever did and never did But I haven’t got time to hold on to the crumbs of my past like I used to What’s done is done Turning 25 was a turning point for me, slap bang in the middle of my twenties Teetering on the edge of being an old adolescent and a fully-fledged adult, I made the decision to go into becoming who I’m going to be forever without a removal van full of my old junk [...] 25 is about getting to know who I’ve become without realising And I’m sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened      “Hello” itself is a reminder of exactly why Adele so easily outsells her peers It’s a heart-wrenching ballad about a woman who’s nostalgic for the not-so-distant past: She regrets the way things went down with an ex-lover and wants to apologize, but knows that too much time has passed for her to bother trying to fix it It’s a soulful easy-listening jam with a thunderous hook—a classic Adele sing-along if ever there was one Watch the video, which features Mack Wilds (!!!), below      Adele’s 25 will be released on November 20th on XL/Columbia            Screenshot from YouTube       ", "summary": "20: \"The song [is] a heart-wrenching ballad about a woman who's nostalgic for the not-so-distant past,\" writes Puja Patel on The Concourse \"It's soulful, easy-listening with a thunderous hook—a classic Adele sing-along if there ever was one fav if you’re holding it all in, trying to keep yourself together.\" It's not just the song itself winning praise: \"While the video is intimate, it also has an epic feel to it", "summary_all": "– Adele is out with her first new song in three years, and the Internet is decidedly happy about it Five reactions to \"Hello,\" the first single from Adele's 25, which will be released Nov 20: \"The song [is] a heart-wrenching ballad about a woman who's nostalgic for the not-so-distant past,\" writes Puja Patel on The Concourse \"It's soulful, easy-listening with a thunderous hook—a classic Adele sing-along if there ever was one ..

And remember he charges by hour The company was very unresponsive The whole experience was just nightmare And when I contacted the Frank's express's company kid of the day, no one answered the call Then I emailed them with my terrible experiences No one really responded or tried to solve the issue In all, do yourself a favor and stay away from this company, or at least stay away from a Hispanic foreman called Steve!!!      I've used Frank's Express for a couple moves and both moves have been exceptional However, that changed recently I moved a couple days ago and am sad to say the service was beyond terrible My dresser drawer was broken from the move, I'm STILL missing furniture, and my box of wine is surprisingly absent I emailed them and they said they would look into it It's been over 48 hours and I'm still missing my furniture! I was a repeat customer, but now I will NEVER use this service again AND I'll be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau      It's my Third time I am using Franks Express, will never cheat on them, lol Service as usual TOP, guys arrived on time, team is very Friendly as always, this time I moved my office, guys were very professional, what ever problem I faced with this move these people find a great solutions to resolve it, I had a desk that didn't feat and then it was special order, I was very upset that I couldn't place it the way I want( size of desks was wrong) they did literally everything to make me HAPPY, even tho it was totally my mistake, they even helped me to design my place ;)) The price is very reasonable, customer service is very friendly, guys are awesome If u planing to move with no stress, then I highly recommend Franks Express!!!      I used Franks Express a few weeks back during a time that was stressful and our moving details in flux The team of 3 arrived early on a Sunday, right on time, and made quick work once they got started Their estimated costs are more accurate the more information you have to provide In my case, we used most of our own boxes but relied on the movers for padding fragile pieces and plastic wrapping others Keep in mind any material or product you need from the movers will be an extra cost It's reasonable but just keep this in mind when you get an initial quote from them Again, the more info have for them the more accurate their quote will be All in all I'm happy with the service and would recommend this company to others      HORRIBLE MOVING SERVICE First of all, they emailed me an hour and a half before my move and said they had to cancel because their truck broke down I called them and asked if there was anything they can do for me they said no sorry, not our problem Then I scrambled to find new movers for my 2 pm move and called maybe another 30-40 places for a last minute move I finally find someone who is available to move and set the time with them The movers show up around 2 pm and start moving stuff and do not even tell me where they are from so I assumed it was the new movers WRONG! The movers from FRANKS show up even after canceling on me and after me hiring someone new Half of my stuff is already in the truck so I have to call the new movers and cancel on them when they are already outside of my apartment There was an issue with the building and I had to keep my stuff in storage with them for about a week I get back and I schedule a last minute move with them again on Monday and they say it's okay they will be there at 3 pm then they call me at 3 pm and say they cancel and will not be there and they will come the next day after I already have taken off work now I have to take off again They come drop my stuff off while I have to wait In their truck for 3 hours in the heat They leave all of the boxes in the living room and I have to move them myself to the bedroom This I wasn't even able to check because they wanted me to pay them and leave ALSO THEY GAVE ME SOMEONE ELSE'S STUFF WITH THEIR PASSPORTS AND CHECKBOOK INSIDE!!! I email Sophie who is the worst of all, and let her know they left someone's box in my apartment I told them I will be at work late and I will not be home for awhile and they REPEATEDLY CALL ME 15 times that day One guy also texted me and called me to say I WILL WAIT OUTSIDE YOUR APARTMENT FOR YOU UNTIL YOU GET HOME I tell them I am working late and we can schedule a time I tried to leave the box with the mailroom and they said no so I left work and came back to do this for them and they said they would compensate me and NOTHING The guy who came to pick up the box AN HOUR LATE looks at me and said is there something you wanted?? I have never been harassed this much in my life They are very selfish movers and are horrible and always LATE!      I spoke with Tatania at Frank's moving, and she was quite helpful in getting me situated for a move I am currently Living in North Carolina my son lives in New York City He wanted to take some possessions out of our storage unit which could have been a little chaotic But, with her help and scheduling, it all went quite well The movers did a good job, and I would definitely recommend this service      One star for the snarky response We used your service three times because you're the cheapest we could find and, unfortunately, other members of my family are more forgiving than I am You get what you pay for but that is still no excuse for such terrible service Please see this article: http://ew.com/article/2016/07/13/tituss-burgess-yelp-review/ for someone else that had a terrible experience with this moving company We will NEVER use your services again and will be sure to inform all friends and family how horrible your service has been      The most unprofessional, unreliable company I have dealt with We had movers scheduled for 11am and when we hadn't heard from them by 12 we called We had to call 5 times before anyone picked up They told us the truck got in an accident and they were waiting for the police We requested they call us back when they had an update After an hour of not hearing back from them we called and once again had to try several times to get in touch The man we were dealing with who claimed to be the manager was extremely disrespectful and offered no solutions or apology We had to call again at 230pm to find out that the police had shown up and the truck was going to be here in the next 2 hours We eventually cancelled due to the unreliability and unprofessional behavior of this company Would strongly recommend against using them      Overall good job with the move, however, customer service was so terrible that it was really worth docking 3 stars over The move started and ended well It was done in good time I even walked a few blocks to the ATM because the guys said they preferred cash and tipped them $50 At the end of the move the guys told me they brought everything up and I trusted that Maybe it is my fault for not checking to make sure every item was there But afterwards while I was unpacking I noticed I was missing 1 bag This was a white garbage bag so I figured maybe they thought it was trash in the truck I reached out plenty of times to the woman I was corresponding with over email and finally got a call about a week later The call was unproductive The man on the phone tells me that his guys remember putting the bag in my apartment and that I probably didn't lock the door and let someone steal it How is this an appropriate thing to say? I'm fully aware of who comes in my apartment and no one is coming in to steal a white garbage bag full of pillows over a 50'' flat screen TV anyways He said there was nothing they could do for me and that if I left a bad review that they would sue me for slander I guess he isn't aware that in order to be sued for slander you have to be lying? Nonetheless, I understand if you can't find my belongings (especially after a week) but to threaten me with court proceedings and not try to remedy the situation is a little much And yes, you may think all this for pillows? Well, it happened to be pillows with 1 of 2 pillow cases for multiple sheet sets and a duvet So now I have to buy new pillows, sheet sets, set of decorative pillows and a duvet Blown      They were amazing I was robbed and had to cancel last minute They were super accommodating to help me reschedule The move the fast and accommodating      Absolutely fantastic! The team moved quickly, wasting no time They had a spare bag of tools to help with things that I had not been prepared for They took apart a desk and put it back together upon arrival, I didn't even have to ask It was a tough job, 4 flight walkup in manhattan with very heavy objects including treadmills These guys are pros, and super friendly and fun to boot Super impressed they found parking for the truck, they can navigate that thing anywhere They even gave me a ride! Above and beyond service, at a great price      I did a move yesterday 4/30 and I must say I can't more pleased with my service! It was super cheap to me and well worth the $50 tip that I added on the service Mike and his partner were super efficient with their time and moving my items The wrapped all necessary items with no complaints and did an excellent job with handling everything with care They even let me ride in the truck which I appreciate so much bc I did not want to call an Uber Also, I booked 2 days before and was able to get a spot confirmed plus they arrived early! Thanks so much Mike and Franks express for your amazing service!      I did my move on 4/18/17 and I am more than satisfied with the work the three men did on my move from storage in Brooklyn, NY to my new place in Manhattan They arrived on time after I just had another moving company cancel on me at the very last minute They were able to take care of my move the same day (just wished I would've been able to complete the move before rush hour traffic set in) Just a sidebar, if you can avoid doing your move between 3 & 4 please do because it doesn't leave room to beat rush hour traffic at all Anyway, the 3 men were professional and worked non-stop I felt for them because I had a walk up and 2 flights of stairs with very heavy boxes They didn't complain at all still did there job and even the unloading didn't take as long as I had expected being they had to go back and forth up steps Though if I had 4 movers it would've went a bit quicker but again I can't complain I only did what I could afford to do I moved a small 5x10 unit and they were able to load the truck just under hour and a half time if it wasn't for traffic I would've probably been just under $400 for the move but I can't complain I still got a great rate even with being stuck in traffic Thank you Franks Express Movers you exceeded my expectations I highly recommended them if you need to hire a professional moving company      My movers were fast, professional, friendly, and took care to protect my fragile valuable, including my antique violin I would defiantly use them again They took apart my bed and put it back together, and wrapped my mattress so it stayed spotless      These owners are thieves The actual workers are kind and great This company doesn't know how to articulate and specify their fees They leave it at the time of payment to over charge the individual I had a fridge move from one garage to another within 28 minutes drive from each other, total move time was 54 minutes This company wanted me to pay $330 (2 hours for moving and 1 hour travel time) No where in the email estimate was it written minimum estimate of $330 It even said, Please be advised that the estimate above is not a flat rate I was under the impression it could be less and the max $330 The owner/boss gets on the phone and tries to sweet talk me into paying telling me that you knew the estimate was the minimum I explained that nowhere in the writing was that word written there I refuse to pay for time that wasn't used And if it was I could have hired friends or workers and rented a uhaul rather then hiring your services I told him he could take me to court I'm only paying what's fair He threatened me with the cops I agreed to calling the cops Cops came and settled the matter and advised me to go to court Watch out for this company It's unfortunate, because the workers were great In response to the company's reply.... Interesting the friend that recommended you used your service for the SAME FRIDGE MOVING BETWEEN THE SAME LOCATIONS And your auto for him was We can send 2 movers and a van for $50/hr total of $120 which includes 1hr of working time (your working time starts from arriving of a truck to pick up address and finishes when a truck leaves your drop off address, travel time from pick up address to drop off address includes in working time) and 1 hr of travel time (for our guys to get back to the base), $20 for gas Amazing that your charges change so dramatically      This company deserves extra stars We had to move on May 31st this year (2017) We weren't going far (from East Village to Chelsea), but we had a lot of boxes and some heavy furniture Henry & his crew showed up On Time and got straight to work Things that we didn't wrap, they wrapped quickly and efficiently (e.g - couch, credenza, table, etc.) They cleared out or old apartment super fast and loaded into the new apartment lickety-split We were even shocked at how quick and efficient they were On top of it all, all of our belongings were handled with care Nothing was missing or lost, nothing was broken HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!      Franks Express was great! Our movers were very nice and helpful It was also a really great price (we looked at prices for other moving companies and Franks had the lowest price even with an additional hour of work & extra fees) Would definitely use them again!

Because he’s very concerned with contraceptives and pharmaceuticals that are going in the mouths of everybody else’s 15-year-old daughter,” Tantaros said, according to Media Matters      And that same year the NRA had the audacity to reference the secret service protection of Malia and Sasha in a controversial ad suggesting the president was a “hypocrite” on gun control When Obama was running for president in 2008, he stated emphatically that politicians’ families should be “off limits.” But that hasn’t stopped some of his political enemies from occasionally taking potshots at his children      If there’s any consolation, it’s nothing new Rush Limbaugh famously compared Chelsea Clinton to a dog and said Amy Carter was the “most unattractive presidential daughter in the history of the country.”      This piece has been updated since its original publication ", "summary": "Elizabeth Lauten is resigning as communications director for Rep Her comments—for which she apologized—helped her name to garner 22,000 mentions on Twitter in a 24-hour period, MSNBC reports AND shagging #pandora.\" She called the post an accident.", "summary_all": "– After her public comments on the Obama girls' lack of \"class\" went viral, a Republican congressional staffer is stepping down from her post Elizabeth Lauten is resigning as communications director for Rep Steven Fincher, she tells NBC News Her comments—for which she apologized—helped her name to garner 22,000 mentions on Twitter in a 24-hour period, MSNBC reports Lauten has run into social-media trouble in the past, adds the Daily Mail: A few months ago, she was behind a tweet on Fincher's feed reading, \"God I love this song And beach music AND shagging #pandora.\" She called the post an accident."}

{"article_number": 891, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " They know who I am      Randy Weber is a fresh face in the U.S House of Representatives, but he swears the Republican leadership team is already wary of him After serving two terms in the Texas statehouse, Weber's reputation precedes him—or so he says      In Texas, where he proudly ranked as the most conservative state representative, Weber was a right-wing rock star He is a staunch ally of Republican Gov Rick Perry, and his work on any given conservative cause célèbre made him a favorite of activist groups, who recognized him with Taxpayer's Hero and Courageous Conservative awards Weber was a leader among the Legislature's right flank, pulling the GOP majority rightward with an agenda focused as much on social issues as fiscal ones      When he entered a nine-way primary last year to succeed Ron Paul, the iconic libertarian whose congressional district overlapped with his own state district, Weber's winning formula was the same as it had always been: No candidate would get to his right—period It worked, and now that he's here, Weber sees no reason to shift strategy      As he explores the corridors of the Capitol, meeting his new colleagues and observing their politics, Weber sees plenty of like-minded members But none of them, he vows, will out-conservative him      ADVERTISEMENT      Sure, after studying his peers in the U.S House, Weber knows some are true believers But he won't compare himself to them And amid a lengthy interview, the reason becomes obvious: Weber believes they should be comparing themselves to him      I don't just say I'm conservative, he says I have boot leather to my gospel      The talkative Texan leans back against the sofa inside his muggy fifth-floor congressional office, showing off his custom-made bullhide cowboy boots Expertly engraved on the shiny black leather, arranged around a circled star emblem, the words: Randy Weber - The State of Texas - House of Representatives      Indeed, Weber leaves no doubt about where he came from or what he came to Washington to do Unlike his predecessor, Paul, whose independent streak and obsession with niche issues often alienated him from the realities of his district, Weber talks constantly of his constituents, and fancies himself a full-spectrum conservative He's a fiscal hawk, like Paul, but on everything else—from foreign policy to drug legalization and social issues—Weber can be found at the far, far right of the ideological spectrum      I'm so Republican, my first name starts with 'R,'  Weber says, smiling broadly I'm so right-wing—well, Randy Weber You do the math      Weber, like many conservatives, says he never wanted to come to Washington Thirty years ago, he was taking junior college classes to learn the trade of air-conditioning, hoping to launch his small business Eventually he did, creating Weber's Air and Heat But after staying active in local GOP politics for decades, first serving as precinct chairman during President Reagan's reelection campaign, Weber got restless He won a close race for the Legislature in 2008, and then won reelection with 85 percent of the vote When Paul stepped down, it was a no-brainer for Weber to enter the race And before long, he was endorsed by Perry, campaigning alongside then-Senate candidate Ted Cruz, and touted by the National Republican Congressional Committee as a prized recruit      The Texan arrived in Congress at a time of deep division within the Republican Party between uncompromising ideologues and party loyalists, and he represents that conflict himself In one breath, he describes himself as a conservative Republican emphasizing the order of those titles, and in the next he's a rabid partisan, referring to Democrats as the other side and pledging to stand toe-to-toe and fight for the GOP platform      So far, Weber has navigated a path that’s allowed him to fulfill both roles In January, Weber was convinced at the GOP retreat in Williamsburg, Va., that Speaker John Boehner was right: A temporary debt-ceiling extension was needed if House Republicans were to start winning some of the small policy battles ahead Many conservatives disagreed and voted against the extension But Weber, after some outreach from the leadership team, decided to give Boehner the benefit of the doubt He backed the speaker’s plan to help beat the other side      But Weber's loyalty has limits, as demonstrated during his time in Texas, where he caused a stir by withdrawing his support for the state House speaker Now, five months after the debt-ceiling vote, Weber says he still has confidence in Boehner's plan But he also warns that his vote won't be won so easily at the next round of negotiations this fall, and hints that his support for the top Republican in Congress is not rock-solid      Weber recalls the Texas incident to make a point: He won't hesitate to cut ties with anyone, including party leaders, whose actions do not reflect his values (It's for this reason, Weber says, that Boehner's team was wary of him early on.) Yes, Weber is a party loyalist who wants to see the GOP succeed But more important to him, Weber wants to see his party adhere to conservative principles      More immediately, Weber wants to escape the shadow of Paul, his internationally known predecessor I am not Dr Ron Paul I am not Dr Ron Paul Jr I am not Dr Ron Paul Lite, he says (He notes that Paul endorsed him last year, but adds with a grin, It didn't hurt that my company does his daughter's air conditioning.)      In many ways, Weber is the anti-Ron Paul Far from focusing narrowly on a few fringe issues and insulating himself from the party base, Weber is carrying the Republican message, whatever the issue      Ask him about the recent Court decision overturning the Defense of Marriage Act, and Weber replies: Apparently the Supreme Court is in collusion with the president and his injustice department, where they decide not to uphold the laws or defend the Constitution      Mention immigration, and Weber responds matter-of-factly: If you say the word amnesty—the 'A-word,' so to speak—it's DOA If there's even a hint of amnesty in my district, it's dead on arrival      If there's one area where Weber is eager to hang his hat, it's energy When President Obama addressed the House Republican conference in March, Weber made a beeline for the commander-in-chief      Mr President, I want to introduce myself I'm Randy Weber I took Ron Paul's spot, he remembers telling Obama When the president shook his hand, Weber cut to the chase: The Keystone Pipeline terminates in Port Arthur, Texas, smack dab in the middle of his district We want that pipeline, Weber told Obama, twice, emphasizing the jobs it would create      According to Weber, Obama smiled and said the oil would be shipped overseas anyway Weber dismissed the president’s point, arguing that companies like Nike, Apple, and Toyota do the same thing (“I should have said Ford,” he says with a chuckle.)      This, Randy Weber says, is vintage Randy Weber: Rarely afraid of an argument, and never shy about challenging authority      The president of the United States knows who Weber is After Williamsburg, so does the speaker of the House And in a town captivated by the influence of a few uncompromising House conservatives, Weber is hoping that before long everyone else will, too ", "summary": "", "summary_all": "– Ahead of last night's State of the Union Address, a Republican congressman tweeted his thoughts on the president: \"On floor of house waitin on 'Kommandant-In-Chef' [sic] .. the Socialistic dictator who's been feeding US a line or is it 'A-Lying?'\" Texas Rep Randy Weber's office has confirmed the authenticity of the tweet, the Huffington Post notes The first-term congressman later added, per the Washington Post, \"SOTU = Sorry Our Time's Up POTUS = Poor Obama Trashed US We shouldn't be surprised He promised to 'fundamentally change US' Boy is he?!\" Weber was elected in 2012, taking over Ron Paul's spot in Congress If his name still isn't ringing a bell, the Huffington Post points to this description of him, from a July 2013 National Journal profile: \"Freshman aims to be the next Republican troublemaker, if only someone would pay attention.\""}

- video explainer      Abu Qatada – who successive British home secretaries tried to deport to Jordan on terror-related charges – has joined Maqdisi as one of the most prominent radical clerics to publicly attack Isis, and his statements of condemnation have been even more scathing Initially, their strategy seemed to be to bring Isis back under the authority of al-Qaida, using something like a good cop, bad cop approach: Maqdisi played the role of the disappointed father, admonishing and giving guidance in equal measure, while Abu Qatada has poured increasing amounts of scorn on them      The list of Isis’s crimes that have offended Maqdisi and Abu Qatada is long They include creating division within the wider jihadi movement, publicly snubbing Zawahiri and establishing a caliphate to which Isis demands every other jihadi swear fealty or face death For more than a year both say they have worked behind the scenes, negotiating with Isis – including with Baghdadi himself – to bring the group back into the al-Qaida fold, to no avail “Isis don’t respect anyone They are ruining the wider jihadi movement and are against the whole ummah [Muslim nation],” Abu Qatada said      Isis are ruining the wider jihadi movement and are against the whole ummah Abu Qatada      Isis has been sufficiently worried by the increasingly vehement criticism from Maqdisi and Abu Qatada to embark on a social media campaign against them – said to have been sanctioned by Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, Isis’s chief propagandist Isis social media accounts berate the two al-Qaida clerics as “stooges” of the west, part of a growing conspiracy against the caliphate The sixth issue of Isis’s English-language magazine, Dabiq, featured a full-page picture of Maqdisi and Abu Qatada, labelled as “misleading scholars” who should be avoided more than the devil himself “Qatada and I have been critical of them,” Maqdisi said “They hate that.”      The two ideologues make an odd pair in the fight against Isis Qatada is 6ft 3in tall, broad shouldered and lumbering, while Maqdisi is rake thin and full of hyperactive energy, bounding round the room and speaking at double speed; at serious moments, Maqdisi is given to making a sudden joke or bursting into giggles Sometimes they will go for walks with each other in the Jordanian countryside More often they travel long distances by road after being asked to attend funerals of fallen al-Qaida fighters      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Abu ­Muhammad al-Maqdisi, the intellectual godfather of al-Qaida Photograph: Mustafa Khalili      Maqdisi’s notoriety has ensured that he has spent most of the past two decades in and out of jail (He claims to have been subject to torture – which is indeed widespread in Jordanian prisons; pulling the hairs out of a radical’s beard, he said, is one favoured method of inflicting pain.) It is widely believed that the Jordanians released him again this February because they realised, with Isis rampaging across the region, that his stature made him a valuable ally in the struggle against the militant group      But Maqdisi and Qatada have looked on as Isis’s young radicals rampage from victory to victory – cursing, mocking and betraying the old guard as they go, while al-Qaida, largely guided by veterans of the Afghan era, has been brought to its knees in this jihadi civil war      As Qatada poured tea into small glass tumblers, he began reeling off images to better communicate the depth of his loathing for Isis He likes speaking in metaphors The group, he said, was “like a bad smell” that has polluted the radical Islamic environment No, they were better described as a “cancerous growth” within the jihadi movement – or, he continued, like the diseased branch of a fig tree that needs to be pruned before it kills the entire organism      The race to save Peter Kassig | Ali Younes, Shiv Malik, Spencer Ackerman and Mustafa Khalili Read more      Qatada, who was once described by the British Special Immigration Appeals Commission as a “truly dangerous individual … at the centre of terrorist activities associated with al‑Qaida”, has a strained, high-pitched voice, like an alto version of Marlon Brando in The Godfather; he speaks slowly, pausing for effect His broad frame easily filled one of the throne-like Louis-XIV-style armchairs that line his reception room Comfortably ensconced, he turned to yet another metaphor to describe how Isis has recruited a generation of young Muslims who barely remember the 9/11 attacks “You go to a restaurant and they present to you this beautiful meal It looks so delicious and tempting But then you go into the kitchen and you see the dirt and the filth and you’re disgusted.”      Both men are particularly appalled, they said, by the way Isis has used their scholarship to cloak its savagery in ideological legitimacy, to gain recruits and justify its battle with al-Qaida and its affiliates “Isis took all our religious works,” Maqdisi said “They took it from us – it’s all our writings, they are all our books, our thoughts.” Now, Abu Qatada said, “they don’t respect anyone”      Such impudent behaviour, the two men agreed, would never have been accepted in the days when Bin Laden was alive “No one used to speak against him,” Maqdisi lamented “Bin Laden was a star He had special charisma.” But despite their personal affection for his successor, Zawahiri – whom they call “Dr Ayman” – they both admit that he does not possess the authority and control to rebuff the threat from Isis From the “very beginning” of his tenure, Zawahiri lacked “direct military or operational control,” Qatada said “He has become accustomed to operating in this decentralised way – he is isolated.”      According to Maqdisi, al-Qaida’s organisational structure has “collapsed” Zawahiri, Maqdisi said, “operates solely based on allegiance There is no organisational structure There is only communication channels, and loyalty.” And unfortunately for Zawahiri, Isis has done its utmost to ensure that loyalty is in short supply      Facebook Twitter Pinterest The radical cleric Abu Qatada says Isis is a ‘cancerous growth’ within the jihadi movement Photograph: Mustafa Khalili      Dr Munif Samara – a veteran of the jihad in Afghanistan and a close associate of Maqdisi and Qatada, who sat with both men as they were interviewed – painted an even more gloomy picture of al-Qaida’s position A GP who runs a free clinic treating injured Syrian fighters and civilians, Samara has more experience than Maqdisi or Qatada with the day-to-day operations of jihadi organising, and has often handled the affairs of the two men during their frequent jail stints He said that donations, which once came in waves of “hundreds of thousands”, have dried up as donors directed their money to Isis, or else refused to fund further bloodletting between the two groups Another former al-Qaida member, Aimen Dean – who defected to become a spy for British intelligence – told the Guardian that one of his sources in Pakistan’s tribal areas said the finances of al-Qaida central in Waziristan were so desperate that it was reduced at one point last year to selling its laptops and cars to buy food and pay rent      Samara described Isis’s fight against al-Qaida as an attempt to bring the older group down from within “At this moment, we do believe there is a coup d’etat under way within al-Qaida itself,” he said      * * *      In the decade after 9/11, al-Qaida attracted money, initiates and prestige like no other jihadi group in history It grew to command the loyalty of a wide network of terrorist branches and affiliates that stretched from Europe to Africa and South Asia Never before had so many geographically disparate groups been united under one banner Bin Laden achieved this feat, at least in part, by remaining ideologically flexible He refused to be proscriptive on small matters of faith, avoiding the kind of disputes that had ripped apart other jihadi coalitions in the past In keeping with its formal name – Tandheem Qaidat al-Jihad, The Organisation for the Base of Jihad – al-Qaida acted as a hub for militants to make connections and receive financial and organisational support Regional commanders were entrusted with a great deal of operational freedom      The finances of al-Qaida were so desperate that it was reduced to selling its laptops and cars to buy food and pay rent      In return, al-Qaida’s leadership demanded one thing above all else: loyalty Its commanders were strictly vetted before being appointed; only those known from the battlefields of Afghanistan, Bosnia or Chechnya – and deemed to have the requisite knowledge of Islamic scholarship – were elevated to the group’s upper echelons On their appointment, these senior commanders swore a blood oath to Bin Laden himself      When Zawahiri took over after Bin Laden’s death in 2011, he found himself geographically isolated While he was hiding out, according to numerous sources, in the mountains on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, the centre of jihadi activity had moved thousands of miles away, to Syria and Iraq As Pakistan’s army and American drones tightened their net around al-Qaida central, it became harder and harder for Zawahiri to maintain contact with his commanders in the field “What is leadership,” Samara asked, “if your leader is in Afghanistan and your soldiers are in Iraq?”      In fact, al-Qaida’s main branch in the Middle East, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), had long been a source of difficulty Since its effective creation in 2003, under the leadership of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, ISI had been happy to use al-Qaida’s brand name and its money, but often ignored pleas for closer communication with central command – even when they came from Bin Laden himself In 2010, they crossed a line: ISI appointed a new leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, without prior approval from al-Qaida, whose senior leaders knew almost nothing about the man – where he had come from, his military experience, whether he could be trusted      In a revealing communique seized during the raid on Bin Laden’s hideaway in Abbottabad, Adam Gadahn – the American al-Qaida member and frequent spokesman – voiced his disgust with ISI’s lack of respect Writing to Bin Laden in January 2011, he asked why ISI should be permitted to sully al-Qaida’s name with its indiscriminate slaughter when it could not even bother to keep in touch with the group’s leadership “Maybe,” he wrote, “it is better for them not to be in the ranks of the mujahideen, as they are just like a polluted spot that should be removed and sanitised and cleared from the ranks.” Less than six months after receiving the letter, Bin Laden was dead Now it fell to Zawahiri, a man of lesser standing, to deal with the problem      By this time, ISI had been pushed to the brink of collapse by US and Iraqi forces – but the Syrian civil war gave the group a chance to rebuild As the conflict began to intensify, Baghdadi quietly dispatched one of his junior officers, Abu Muhammad al-Joulani, across the border in late 2011 to take advantage of the chaos Equipped with funds, weapons, and some of ISI’s best soldiers, Joulani’s group – which would soon be known as the Nusra Front – quickly became the most formidable fighting force in Syria By 2013, Joulani was such a powerful commander in his own right that Baghdadi feared he was on the verge of obtaining Zawahiri’s support to elevate himself as the leader of an independent al-Qaida branch in Syria      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaida, has struggled to assert his authority from his hideout in Waziristan Photograph: AFP/Getty Images      On 8 April 2013, Baghdadi launched a pre-emptive strike – whose consequences would rip apart the banner of unity that had long presided over the jihadi movement In an audio recording released online, Baghdadi declared that the Nusra Front and ISI would officially become one organisation Nusra’s battle-stained banners, which hung over their newly captured headquarters in Syrian cities such as Raqqa, Aleppo and Homs would be replaced The merged organisation would be called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or more simply Isis The rebrand was effective immediately Two days later, Joulani replied with his own audio message He rejected Baghdadi’s “invitation” to merge – and pledged an oath of loyalty directly to Zawahiri, appealing to the “sheikh of jihad” to resolve the dispute      Within 24 hours, Zawahiri dispatched a private message urging calm He said he wanted both commanders to send him representations before he would rule on this spat, which had, thanks to the internet, become embarrassingly public Baghdadi made it clear that he was not willing to compromise: in a personal message, he warned Zawahiri that any hint of support for the “traitor” would have “no cure except the spilling of more blood”      On 23 May, Zawahiri delivered his verdict: Isis, which had been created without prior approval, would have to be “dissolved”; Baghdadi was ordered to restrict his operations to Iraq Meanwhile, his former junior, Joulani, would become the leader of al-Qaida’s official branch in Syria Both men, Zawahiri added, had a year to prove themselves, after which al-Qaida central would decide on what measures to take next Like any suspended sentence, it was both an offer of redemption and a threat: Baghdadi could prosper by playing nicely within the new rules, or lose his position within al-Qaida entirely Finally, to ensure his accord was adhered to peacefully, Zawahiri dispatched an emissary, Abu Khalid al-Suri, in whom he vested the power to resolve any further disputes      One former senior member of ISI who did not want to be named told the Guardian that Baghdadi was incensed by Zawahiri’s letter: he was shocked to be treated as an equal to Joulani and ordered to stay out of the Syrian conflict into which he had invested so much According to Maqdisi, Baghdadi contemptuously dismissed Zawahiri’s envoy “Suri told Baghdadi, if you stick to these points and you go back to Iraq, I will not make this order public,” Maqdisi said “Instead, Isis refused the orders, and then started attacking Zawahiri – saying, ‘Al-Qaida is gone, it’s burned out.’”      After Suri made good on the threat to go public with Zawahiri’s humiliating diktat – which was released to al-Jazeera in June – Baghdadi issued his own blunt and unbending reply: “As long as we have a pulse or an eye that blinks,” he said, Isis was there to stay It was the first time a major al-Qaida figure had ever publicly defied the organisation’s leader “That was an alarm bell,” Abu Qatada recalled      That summer, Isis began preparing for war: swelling its ranks and readying itself to claim back Syrian territory from Nusra, which it believed was rightly its own In an astonishing series of prison breaks, it freed hundreds of Iraq’s most dangerous inmates by firing mortar rounds at walls and using car bombs to blow apart entrances According to secret documents recently obtained by Der Spiegel, Isis also began implementing plans to take advantage of the stream of thousands of men who were flooding into Syria from Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Europe Without ties to native Syrians, these foreign fighters were likely to remain loyal And they needed to be loyal, because instead of fighting Assad – as they had come to Syria to do – they would be used to stab the homegrown anti-Assad rebel groups in the back      * * *      One of Maqdisi’s close associates in Jordan is a man who we will call Raheem, a personal aide to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who helped found the organisation that evolved into Isis – and who had an inside view of the group’s transformation after Baghdadi took power A hulking figure, standing at more than 6ft 4in, he appeared suddenly one day at Maqdisi’s house, after hearing a rumour that Isis followers had assaulted his sheikh In an interview a few weeks later, Raheem described the men running Isis as a different breed from the religiously inspired jihadis of al-Qaida; in fact, he said, the group had been run for several years by men who once served Saddam Hussein’s Ba’athist regime      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Where does Isis get its money? - video explainer      According to Raheem, when Zarqawi was in charge, it was his unofficial policy to shut out anyone from the secular nationalist Ba’ath party Zarqawi firmly believed that Iraqis in general, and Ba’athists in particular, lacked piety Under Hussein, Iraq had been a secular state, and Islamism – the body of intellectual work that has turned Islam from a religion into a full-blown system of governance – had been brutally suppressed “There were very few Iraqis who were exposed to other ideas,” Raheem said “They were nationalists and were highly influenced by the Ba’ath.”      After Zarqawi’s death in 2006, ISI was almost destroyed by US forces and Sunni tribes revolting against its brutal violence To save themselves, Raheem said, ISI’s inner circle decided that the group needed to broaden its ranks: revolutionary Islamist credentials were no longer essential – if you could recite a few lines of the Qur’an and grow a beard, you could sign up The former Ba’athists, who had run Iraq for decades, were invaluable new recruits: Hussein’s former military officers knew the vulnerabilities of the Iraqi army; his former intelligence officials knew the power brokers in each town and village Since the regime’s overthrow, these men had lost their incomes and their authority; now the Islamic State of Iraq would serve as a vehicle for them to regain their status (Documents obtained by Der Spiegel have revealed the major role played by a former colonel in Hussein’s air intelligence service, known as Haji Bakr, who is said to have been the architect of Isis’s takeover of northern Syria; according to Raheem, he brought an entire Ba’athist unit with him when he joined the group.)      Raheem alleged that it was largely these men – former Ba’athists who became senior members of ISI – who nominated Baghdadi as the organisation’s new leader in 2010 Until his appointment, Raheem said, Baghdadi was regarded as a minor figure, quiet and uncharismatic He had no military experience, and his scholarship was of little note, though he held a PhD in Islamic studies But he made the ideal front man: on paper, at least, he was a religious scholar; his family claimed to be descended from the prophet Muhammad; and most importantly of all, he was not himself a Ba’athist      Isis: the inside story | Martin Chulov Read more      After Baghdadi’s appointment, ISI’s inner circle closed ranks around its chosen leader It discontinued all but the most cursory communication with al-Qaida central, and slowly, the few remaining senior figures considered loyal to Zawahiri were either deliberately sidelined or killed off on the battlefield By the time Zawahiri’s fateful letter arrived in May 2013, Raheem said, there was not a single person in Isis’s senior leadership who had once belonged to al-Qaida      Later that year, while the rest of the world was fixated on Assad’s chemical weapons, Isis planned to seize control of the 500-mile border between Turkey and Syria: if it could hold the border crossings, which supplied the main rebel groups with food, medicine, weapons and new recruits, Isis would have Nusra and its other rivals by the throat By December, strategically important border towns began to fall, one by one, to Isis fighters Isis fighters rode into towns whose freedom from Assad had been won at great cost, stripped factories bare, and turfed out – or killed – other fighters and their families They kidnapped high-level commanders from other rebel groups, and murdered Syrian civilians who had been involved in the earliest mass protests against Assad, calculating that these were the only people brave enough to confront Isis in the future      In December 2013, Hussein Suleiman, a handsome young physician who was also a senior officer of the Islamic Front rebel group, was sent to make peace with a local Isis unit after trouble broke out at a checkpoint near Lake Assad in eastern Syria When Suleiman did not return to base, Islamic Front officials contacted Isis, which confirmed they were holding him prisoner as a spy Outraged, the Islamic Front demanded his release Surely Isis could not go around arresting peace brokers? At the very least, they asked that his crimes be tried in an independent sharia court Isis refused      When Isis released Suleiman as part of a prisoner exchange on 31 December, the Islamic Front received a mutilated corpse: his right ear had been cut off, his teeth were knocked out, one of his legs had been broken The young doctor had been tortured, and the top of his head was blown off The next day, the Islamic Front posted pictures of his mangled body online, next to those of how he used to look They spread rapidly on social media and sparked protests in towns across Syria against Isis brutality In Isis-controlled towns, fighters shot at the protesters, fuelling more outrage      Within days, Syria’s major rebel groups – including Nusra, the country’s al-Qaida affiliate – banded together to declare war on Isis Thousands of militants were killed over the first few months of 2014, as battles raged between Isis and the other rebel factions, with senior commanders on both sides kidnapped, tortured and murdered As their positions were overrun, Isis was forced to retreat from western Syria It began consolidating its control over the east, the area closest to Iraq, and the location of many of Syria’s oil fields There, Nusra and Isis fought viciously, in and around the city of Raqqa and along the banks of the Euphrates      On 16 January 2014, Zawahiri’s envoy, Abu Khalid al-Suri, published a message online He tweeted that Isis was seeking to corrupt the jihad as it had done in Iraq: militants should direct their bombs at the infidels, he declared, not at their fellow jihadis Seventeen days later, Zawahiri played his final card: Isis was expelled from al-Qaida      For Isis, there was no turning back To make clear that reconciliation was off the table, they sent their former boss a message that he would not forget On 21 February, five men fought their way into the compound in Aleppo where Suri was staying When their target appeared, one of the attackers detonated his suicide vest Zawahiri’s loyal servant, who had been sent from Afghanistan to make peace, now lay dead      * * *      From their jail cells in Jordan, Abu Qatada and Maqdisi watched the vicious struggle between Isis and al-Qaida with growing concern For Abu Qatada, it felt like history was repeating itself In the early 1990s, he had been a fervent supporter of the Algerian Groupe Islamique Armé (GIA) – issuing fatwas that gave GIA terrorists license to kill with little discrimination But when the GIA inevitably began murdering rival militants, Abu Qatada assembled a group of radical scholars to denounce the organisation, helping to strip it of intellectual credibility among fellow jihadis Now, more than 20 years later, he wanted Maqdisi to join him in a similar campaign against Isis – to publicly shame the group as extremists acting outside the accepted rules of jihad      Maqdisi asked Abu Qatada to hold off He still hoped that Isis could be brought back within the fold Some of Isis’s most senior members had already written to him in prison signalling their contrition One letter said: “We know that we have made mistakes … We know that among our soldiers and clerics there are some who are extremists … But they are the minority.” (It was signed: “Your son, one of the sharia legislators for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria written by request and on behalf of some of his brothers.”) With the right plan for reconciliation, Maqdisi believed that unity might be restored      Using intermediaries to keep Zawahiri informed of his attempts at arbitration, Maqdisi reached out to Isis’s inner circle in late 2013, approaching one of his former students, a young Bahraini named Turki Binali Binali had been his protege – a pupil of “extraordinary passion”, in Maqdisi’s words Some nicknamed him “Maqdisi junior” After joining Isis, Binali rapidly rose into its highest ranks: he was appointed as Baghdadi’s official biographer, and by spring 2014, he had been named Isis’s chief “scholar at arms” In theory, a single decree from Binali’s pen could end the civil war between Isis and al-Qaida      Maqdisi, who dispatched two of his own students to meet Binali in person, said that their initial exchanges were encouraging: he warned Binali that unless Isis was willing to negotiate an end to the conflict with al-Qaida, the group risked condemnation from the world’s most eminent jihadi sheikhs In response, Binali assured his “beloved teacher” that Baghdadi wanted nothing more than to reach agreement with al-Qaida But as months passed, and the fighting continued, Maqdisi came to believe Binali had little intention of settling the feud      How, Binali asked Maqdisi, could Zawahiri have praised the Arab Spring when the people who had risen up in Egypt and elsewhere were calling for democracy, not sharia? Why, he asked, did Zawahiri refer respectfully to the US president as “Mr Obama”? Perhaps, Binali intimated, al-Qaida had decided to quit the jihad and settle into a quieter existence as a peaceful organisation? Maqdisi thought these questions were “absurd”, he said – “meaningless, insignificant points”, which Isis had “never mentioned in the past”      By spring 2014, communications between student and teacher had seriously deteriorated; at one point, Binali slighted Maqdisi by suggesting that old age had confused him After drafting a short online article entitled “My former Sheikh”, Binali stopped replying altogether On 26 May 2014, Maqdisi deemed the negotiations dead and, backed by his fellow al-Qaida ideologues, issued a fatwa against Isis      “It has become necessary that we tell the truth, after we exhausted all the possibilities of advice and all hopes of making Isis return to the path of truth,” Maqdisi wrote The rebellious organisation, he declared, had no “Islamic pretext” Baghdadi, his commanders, and their religious officials were “deviants” who had “disobeyed the orders of their leaders and head scholars” He instructed Isis’s soldiers to defect to the Nusra Front, and decreed that no Islamic website should host Isis messages      This was a serious threat to Isis’s legitimacy, and even its future According to a series of detailed leaks from an anonymous Twitter account – much of which the Guardian has subsequently verified – Binali approached Baghdadi with a stark appraisal of Isis’s vulnerable position The caliphate would eventually collapse, he said, if the jihad’s leading scholars and veterans continued to stand against Isis The project could not be sustained unless Isis recruited influential supporters      Binali’s solution to this problem was simple: if Isis could not win support, it would buy it In the summer and autumn of 2014, messages were sent to Maqdisi, Abu Qatada and about a dozen other top-ranking clerics, inviting them to relocate to the caliphate, where they could work without fear of imprisonment (Baghdadi even wrote a personal letter to Maqdisi to persuade him to come) To sweeten the deal, payments of up to $1m were promised Binali also sent word to al-Qaida’s branch in Yemen that Isis would offer its leader and his men $10m to publicly pledge allegiance to Baghdadi; a similar offer, for $5m, was made to the al-Qaida affiliate in Libya      Binali’s scheme had mixed results Maqdisi, Qatada and the other prominent scholars rejected the offer out of hand, as did Yemen’s al-Qaida commander But Binali appeared to have captured the interest of several jihadi factions across the globe In November, Isis trumpeted public oaths of loyalty from jihadi militants in Egypt, Libya, Pakistan and even Yemen, al-Qaida’s strongest redoubt Suddenly, the group’s influence was extending beyond Syria and Iraq, into the rest of the Islamic world      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dr Munif Samara, the jihadi doctor and close associate of Maqdisi and Abu Qatada Photograph: Mustafa Khalili      There would be other exchanges between Maqdisi and Binali later that year, including a failed attempt to secure the release of the Isis hostage Peter Kassig Their final communication came not long after Kassig’s execution, when Maqdisi once again found himself mediating with Isis On 24 December 2014, a Jordanian military aircraft was shot down over Isis territory near the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, and its pilot taken hostage; Maqdisi heard the news when the prison imam dedicated a prayer to the man Soon after, Maqdisi sounded out Jordanian officials about an idea, originally suggested by his friend Dr Munif Samara, to secure the return of the pilot Although Jordanian officials were wary, believing that the pilot could have been killed already, they authorised the plan      Communicating primarily via Telegram messenger, an app that allows for encrypted communications, Maqdisi sent word to Isis in January of this year that the Jordanians would be willing to conduct a prisoner swap: in return for the pilot, they would release a woman named Sajida al-Rishawi In 2005, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had sent al-Rishawi and her husband on a mission to Jordan, where they were to explode bomb belts at the Radisson SAS hotel as part of a coordinated series of suicide bombings Rishawi’s device did not detonate, and she was arrested, languishing on death row for the next decade In his approach to Isis, Maqdisi said, he reminded the group’s senior leaders that, as the inheritors of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi’s legacy, they had an obligation to save her now      Although Maqdisi is not certain about who he was communicating with, he has no doubt that his messages were being relayed to the most senior members of Isis, including Baghdadi himself The initial response was positive: Maqdisi says he was told that Isis were “eager” to make the trade On social media, Isis supporters suddenly began calling for al-Rishawi’s release      Before any deal could be brokered, the Jordanians instructed Maqdisi to obtain proof that the pilot was still alive In response, the Isis negotiators sent Maqdisi an electronic file that they claimed would provide proof of life – but the file was password protected      On 3 February, after a few days of tense dialogue, the negotiators finally sent Maqdisi the password to unlock the file When he received it, Maqdisi realised he had been betrayed: the password, in Arabic, was “Maqdisi the pimp, the sole of the tyrant’s shoe, son of the English whore.”      After he typed it in, one humiliating character at a time, a video appeared on Maqdisi’s screen He watched in horror as Isis soldiers muscled the pilot into a cage, doused him in petrol, and burned him alive Three hours later, Isis posted the video on the internet The next day, Sajida al-Rishawi was taken from her cell and executed      * * *      At his house on the outskirts of Zarqa, about 25km from Amman, Maqdisi keeps a large model boat on top of one of his overstuffed bookshelves It’s a strange object to find there: Islamic extremists are not known for their maritime collectibles The boat was a gift from a very senior member of Isis, who built it from pencils and matchsticks while incarcerated in Abu Ghraib Above the boat’s sails hangs a banner that reads “Journey with us,” a quotation from the Quranic retelling of the story of the flood, when Noah reaches out to beckon his son aboard For Maqdisi, it is a symbol of salvation and unity “It’s meant as a message for all Muslims,” he said – one with a special significance for jihadis today, as the factional bloodshed rages on      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Abu ­Muhammad al-Maqdisi’s model boat was made for him by a very senior member of Isis, who built it from pencils and matchsticks while incarcerated in Abu Ghraib Photograph: Mustafa Khalili      Maqdisi and Abu Qatada continue to hope that the unity that once prevailed under bin Laden will return – but they admitted openly that Isis is winning the war on the ground and the propaganda struggle alike “It’s a fluid state of affairs,” Abu Qatada suggested hopefully “At the moment, Isis are drunk on power.” But at some point, he believes, they will need to negotiate with al-Qaida again He pointed out that al-Qaida’s branch in Syria had achieved some recent successes against Assad’s forces, while Maqdisi observed that there were several other branches, including the one in Yemen, whose allegiance remains unquestioned “Its loyalty is strong and clear,” Maqdisi said “When Zawahiri sends a message to Yemen, he knows his orders will be obeyed.”      But the two men believe that the events of the past decade – and especially the war with Isis – are a sign that al-Qaida needs to reappraise its tactics Maqdisi believes that al-Qaida should no longer aim to recruit followers in large numbers; it needs “people of quality”, he said, who thoroughly understand Islamic scholarship, and will not merely deploy it in the furtherance of their own personal ends      In recent years, Maqdisi has even come to believe that al-Qaida’s conception of jihad – one licensed in part by his own scholarship – may have been incorrect, a jihad of “spite” rather than “empowering believers” Even the attacks of 9/11, Maqdisi said, were part of a misguided strategy “The actions in New York and Washington, no matter how great they appeared to be – the bottom line is they were spiteful.”      Maqdisi now wants al-Qaida to begin providing social services, as Hamas has done in Gaza “That kind of enabling jihad will establish our Islamic state It will enable it to become a place of refuge for the weak,” he said Al-Qaida branches in Tunisia and elsewhere have been putting this suggestion into practice – with jihadis guarding hospitals, building infrastructure, and even picking up litter And yet, as one al-Qaida veteran who did not want to be named told the Guardian, local commanders have reported that their soldiers are impatient with these new duties; many would prefer for Zawahiri to swear allegiance to Baghdadi      Munif Samara, the jihadi doctor and close associate of Maqdisi and Abu Qatada, worried that al-Qaida may be crippled by its difficulty attracting new recruits Young soldiers, he said, “want action, they want blood, they want explosions They are sitting in their countries, and either they will be in jail or something like this, and they are waiting for al-Qaida [to do something], and al-Qaida is doing nothing.” For these young men, the lure of Isis is strong      Al-Qaida has long maintained that while the establishment of the caliphate is the ultimate goal, conditions are not yet right: ordinary Muslims need to be educated about “true Islam” for many more years before it can return But it has now been a year since Baghdadi declared his own caliphate – and the longer that Isis can hold its territory and broadcast its military successes to the world, the more credibility it will steal from al-Qaida      As ideologues steeped in almost 1,400 years of Islamic scholarship, Maqdisi and Abu Qatada tend to the long view – for them, the proper perspective on al-Qaida’s present crisis is one of decades rather than months, which may explain their relative optimism about its possibility for renewal For now, however, their fierce attacks on Isis have done little to halt its advances Given the group’s ruthlessness and disdain for criticism, it is hard not to imagine, as one walks away from Maqdisi’s house, that if the war continues, it may not be long before he and Abu Qatada find themselves in the crosshairs      • Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread ", "summary": "– Al-Qaeda's spiritual leaders say the organization is on the verge of \"collapse\" while ISIS thrives The former al-Qaeda branch—booted last year for disobeying Osama bin Laden successor Ayman al-Zawahiri—is attracting money and recruits that have helped it spread from Afghanistan to west Africa, even as an al-Qaeda group in Pakistan sold its laptops and cars to pay for food and rent last year, a former member tells the Guardian Zawahiri \"operates solely based on the allegiance There is no organizational structure,\" says jihadi scholar Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi The Guardian reports al-Qaeda's downfall began with Zawahiri's ascension after bin Laden's death Zawahiri was forced to hide out near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border while fighters that would eventually form ISIS came together in Syria and Iraq \"What is leadership,\" asks an al-Qaeda associate, \"if your leader is in Afghanistan and your soldiers are in Iraq?\" Insiders say ISIS, which won't accept another jihadi group in its territory, is winning the propaganda war as well as the war on the ground", "summary_all": "– Al-Qaeda's spiritual leaders say the organization is on the verge of \"collapse\" while ISIS thrives The former al-Qaeda branch—booted last year for disobeying Osama bin Laden successor Ayman al-Zawahiri—is attracting money and recruits that have helped it spread from Afghanistan to west Africa, even as an al-Qaeda group in Pakistan sold its laptops and cars to pay for food and rent last year, a former member tells the Guardian Zawahiri \"operates solely based on the allegiance There is no organizational structure,\" says jihadi scholar Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi Abu Qatada, a preacher deported from the UK to Jordan to face terror charges in 2013, agrees Zawahiri is \"isolated\" and lacks \"direct military or operational control.\" He blames ISIS, which he calls a \"cancerous growth\" within the jihadi movement The Guardian reports al-Qaeda's downfall began with Zawahiri's ascension after bin Laden's death Zawahiri was forced to hide out near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border while fighters that would eventually form ISIS came together in Syria and Iraq \"What is leadership,\" asks an al-Qaeda associate, \"if your leader is in Afghanistan and your soldiers are in Iraq?\" Insiders say ISIS, which won't accept another jihadi group in its territory, is winning the propaganda war as well as the war on the ground The New York Times reported last week that ISIS militants beheaded 10 members of the Taliban A former intelligence analyst tells the Guardian the US considers ISIS and al-Qaeda to be the same entity and sees the rivalry as \"a squabble within.\" But ISIS is \"basing itself on skills and organizational capabilities and objectives that are much more accelerated and capable than what al-Qaeda's ever had.\""}

the Islamic State enjoyed in Syria and Iraq has not come to pass in Afghanistan      But already, the Islamic State-inspired militants have created a significant shift: The Taliban insurgency, even as it advances against the Western-backed government, is having to wrestle with an insurgent threat of its own      After more than a decade of remaining remarkably unified around the elusive figure of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban are splintering to a degree not seen before, as hundreds of insurgents have shifted their loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State and self-declared caliph of the Muslim world      More is at stake than just which militant Sunni faction controls remote villages Should the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, make larger inroads within Taliban-controlled territory, it could fundamentally change the insurgency While the Taliban have carried out public executions and embraced suicide bombings, the Islamic State’s embrace of violence — and penchant for publicizing it through videos and Internet social media — is extreme even by the Taliban’s standards      Through their history, the Taliban have sought to convince Afghans and foreign leaders that their ambitions are limited to Afghanistan, which the group governed for about five years before being toppled in 2001 A central Taliban demand has always been the rule of Afghanistan by Afghans, a platform that resonates well in a country shaped by a history of dogged resistance to foreign invaders      Unlike the Islamic State, the Taliban have shown a willingness to negotiate with regional powers, albeit in a limited way Recently, the Taliban announced that they had sent a delegation to Iran — which has long viewed the Taliban’s brand of Sunni extremism with a wariness bordering on hostility — as part of a broader series of diplomatic trips to several countries to “discuss bilateral issues, form, expand and strengthen ties.” The move comes at a time when the Iranian government is directly helping the fight against Islamic State units in Syria and Iraq      So far, the number of Islamic State-inspired militants in Afghanistan has remained low compared

fighters allied with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan have declared allegiance to the Islamic State — most are said to be led by former Taliban Some had been thrown out over ideological differences or for insubordination      Perhaps seeking to keep from widening the phenomenon, the Taliban have so far dealt somewhat gingerly with the Islamic State upstarts they find in their midst In several places across the country, they have sent delegations to Islamic State units with what often boils down to a cease and desist message, local leaders say      In Nangarhar, tribal elders speak of several different groups of Islamic State fighters, most numbering several scores of men      In Bati Kot District, about 25 miles southeast of Jalalabad, Maulvi Abbas had told Islamic State fighters based in the village of Chardahi that their black flag was not welcome As a commander who was with the Taliban when they seized power in the 1990s, he is seen as a notable local figure      One resident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation by militants, characterized Maulvi Abbas’s message as: “The Taliban had been fighting the Afghan government for the last decade, and it wasn’t necessary for the Islamic State to show up.”      The Islamic State’s response was to demand that Maulvi Abbas’s men defect from the Taliban, the resident said A series of skirmishes ensued, during which Maulvi Abbas was taken hostage, several residents as well as a military commander said      On the opposite side of the country, in Farah Province, along Afghanistan’s border with Iran, however, the Taliban have managed to quell the splinter groups’ momentum When the Islamic State established a training camp there this year, it quickly recruited hundreds of young

asking local religious scholars to preach in mosques about how an Islamic State presence in Afghanistan would be a dangerous development This effort seemed to quickly persuade more than half of the Islamic State’s newest recruits to return to the Taliban, Mr Khaliq said      Then the Taliban laid siege to the training camp After days of heavy fighting in late May, the Taliban pursued fleeing Islamic State fighters, eventually securing their surrender after a firefight that killed at least a dozen Taliban and Islamic State fighters, according to Mr Khaliq      Under the terms of the surrender, the Islamic State commanders as well as a few non-Afghan fighters among them were allowed to leave Farah, Mr Khaliq said, but about 55 of the group’s fighters became the Taliban’s prisoners

to its former subordinate division The ongoing war between al-Qaida and Isis has left the US struggling to catch up with the tectonic shifts within the global jihadi movement, intelligence insiders told the Guardian      Maqdisi, who Zawahiri counts as a close friend, is frank about the 63-year-old Egyptian’s situation “He operates solely based on the allegiance There is no organisational structure There is only communication channels and loyalty,” Maqdisi said      Qatada, who was born Omar Mahmoud Othman and has been described by the British government as a “truly dangerous individual”, also says Zawahiri is “isolated” and admits that Isis have been winning the propaganda and ground war against al-Qaida      Qatada was deported from the UK to Jordan to face terror charges after a court battle lasting nearly 10 years with a series of British home secretaries Last summer he was released from custody after being acquitted of all charges Since his release, he has become an increasingly vocal critic of Isis He told the Guardian its members were extremists and a “cancer” growing within the jihadi movement following their assault on al-Qaida over the last two years “[Isis] don’t respect anyone,” he said      Isis was al-Qaida’s branch in the heart of the Middle East until the group was excommunicated from the network in 2014 after disobeying commands from Zawahiri and starting an internecine war with fellow jihadists in Syria which left thousands dead on both sides Today that fight continues and has expanded across Eurasia and the Mediterranean Since declaring the establishment of its so-called Islamic State a year ago, Isis has gone on to build a global network of affiliates and branches that now stretches from Afghanistan to west Africa and competes with al-Qaida in its scale      Isis leaders, who described al-Qaida as a “drowned entity” in issue six of their official English-language publication, Dabiq, have declared that they will not tolerate any other jihadi group in territory where they are operating They have readily delivered on that statement Last week, Isis fighters in Afghanistan were reported to have beheaded 10 members of the Taliban, and on Wednesday al-Qaida in Libya vowed retaliation after blaming Isis for the death of one of its leaders      But the US has been slow to grasp the implications of al-Qaida’s decline and possible collapse despite extensive study of Isis, according to intelligence community insiders “There’s such a cadre of people so closely tied to the al-Qaida brand within the IC [intelligence community] that I think they don’t see what else is going on outside the organisation,” said Derek Harvey, a former intelligence analyst who predicted how resilient the Iraq insurgency would be      Over the past year, a group of junior and mid-level analysts have concluded that Isis advances have pushed al-Qaida to the margins of global jihad A former senior intelligence official who did not want to speak on the record said they had been tracking the split between the two groups with great attention Against them is what Harvey described as “the overwhelming majority of senior intelligence officials looking at this” who he said considered the enmity between Isis and al-Qaida as little more than “a squabble within”      That prevailing view has found expression in repeated public statements by Barack Obama and his senior advisers conflating Isis and al-Qaida or denying that any split between the two organisations is meaningful That raises questions about whether a US counter-terrorism bureaucracy long focused on al-Qaida as a prime threat can grapple with the group’s decline and a different one’s ascent      In a typical comment, Barack Obama in March told Vice that Isis “is the direct outgrowth of al-Qaida in Iraq” Although factually correct, this is substantively misleading: al-Qaida in Iraq was for 10 years al-Qaida’s most fractious and disloyal franchise, even before it began waging its violent campaign against the old guard      The US secretary of state, John Kerry, has depicted the rivalry between the two jihadi groups as cosmetic, and his top Iraq policy official, Brett McGurk, has repeatedly stated: “Isis is al-Qaida.” Kerry’s new spokesman, John Kirby, said in his old job at the Pentagon that Isis, al-Qaida and al-Qaida’s Syrian proxy the Nusra Front “in our minds, from our military perspective, are very much one and the same”      “We’ve got counter-terrorist guys who are focused on counter-terrorism and they grew up fighting the al-Qaida networks, but Isis is a different kind of network,” Harvey said “It’s basing itself on skills and organisational capabilities and objectives that are much more accelerated and capable than what al-Qaida’s ever had.”      However misleading, the conflation of the two groups has political and legal benefits for Obama He launched military action against Isis without congressional approval 10 months ago and a push for retroactive legislative blessing is all but dead in Washington Portraying al-Qaida and Isis as the same thing has allowed the president to claim that the 2001 and 2002 congressional authorisations for attacks on al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein provide the legal foundations for the current campaign      Meanwhile, the US continues to target al-Qaida So far this year, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the Americans have launched 11 drone strikes in Yemen – the most recent came Tuesday night – and 11 more in Pakistan,

(Associated Press)      LOS ANGELES (AP) — Alfonso Cuaron was awarded the top film honor from the Directors Guild of America for Gravity on Saturday night      In the recent bustle of Hollywood shows, Gravity, David O Russell's con caper American Hustle, and Steve McQueen's historical epic 12 Years a Slave were competing in the tightest three-way Oscar race in years But the win gives Cuaron's lost-space-saga an edge on the journey to the Academy Awards      With 10 Oscar nominations, Cuaron's film is likely to gain the most Academy Awards this year American Hustle also has 10 nominations, while 12 Years a Slave has nine The early momentum of 12 Years a Slave has begun to deflate following this evening's upset and the results of the Golden Globes McQueen's film was nominated for seven Globes, but only took home one — best motion picture, drama      However, it is unlikely 12 Years a Slave will go home empty-handed on Oscar night, as actress Lupita Nyong'o, who is nominated for the best supporting Oscar, is the likely favorite      Earning the DGA award makes Cuaron a near shoo-in to win the best director Oscar on March 2 The Directors Guild recipient nearly always goes on to claim the same prize on Hollywood's biggest night      In the 65-year history of the DGA awards, the winner has failed to also take home the best director Oscar just seven times Ben Affleck, who presented Cuaron with his guild award, won the same accolade last year for Argo but was denied a best director nomination at the Oscars However, like many DGA winners, Argo went on to win the best-picture prize at the Oscars      While accepting his trophy, Cuaron recalled looking at satellite images of earth from space      What you cannot see from up there is this bizarre experiment of nature that is the human experience, said Cuaron, a first-time DGA winner That experiment is what directors try to sort out with our films Thankfully, that experience is as diverse as the films as these filmmakers make      Cuaron also thanked his son and Gravity co-writer Jonas Cuaron      Sandra Bullock, the star of Gravity, was on-hand to applaud Cuaron for his honor While introducing the director for his nomination speech, Bullock joked that she could barely understand her director while shooting Gravity      I had no idea whether ice meant ice or ice, she said, pointing to her eye Later, Cuaron shot back at the actress, saying that actors feel that the universe revolves around them When he looked over at Bullock, she pointed to her ear and mouthed, I can't understand you      Jehane Noujaim won the documentary prize for The Square, which was acquired by subscription service Netflix last year and depicts the tumult of the Egyptian Revolution beginning in 2011      Each director gave a nomination speech before the biggest award of the evening was announced and the key stars of films gave their directors glowing introductions Among them was Bradley Cooper of American Hustle, Rob Reiner of The Wolf of Wall Street, Tom Hanks of Captain Phillips, Sara Paulson of 12 Years a Slave      Receiving the loudest applause of the evening were diversity award recipients Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers      We are being given an award for something all of us should be doing anyway, said Rhimes There is such a lack of lack of people hiring women and minorities that when someone does so on a regular basis they are given an award There shouldn't need to be an award The lack of diversity in Hollywood is not because of the lack of talent It's because of the lack of access People hire their friends If it's been a white boy's club for 70 years, that's a lot of white boys hiring one another Rock some boats Something original is what the public is starving for      Jehane Noujaim won the documentary prize for The Square, which was acquired by subscription service Netflix last year and depicts the tumult of the Egyptian Revolution beginning in 2011      I'm very humbled and very grateful, said Noujaim, whose previous documentaries include Startup.com and Control Room ''This film is the most deeply personal film I've made, watching my country change before me when I never

{"article_number": 2438, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " Built by the Third Reich in the run-up to the second world war, the resort at Prora, on the island of Rügen, Germany, was a Nazi vision of tourism Happy, healthy Aryans would stay and play at the 10,000-room complex on the Baltic sea, eating, swimming and even bowling for the Führer Think Hitler’s Cancun      But 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the complex nicknamed the Colossus of Prora is part of a growing debate in modern Germany that pits commercialism against Vergangenheitsbewältigung – the German word for how the country should come to terms with its dark past      Blocks of six-story buildings stretching for 4.5km went up before war slowed construction, leaving an unfinished hulk that was later retrofitted into training grounds and housing for East German soldiers But a group of investors in this seaside town is now doing what the Nazis never could: realising the site’s final stage of transformation into a vacation wonderland Large parts of the complex are being gutted and rebuilt into developments, including one called New Prora that will house luxury beachfront condominiums – half of which have been sold – as well as an upscale hotel and spa      But it’s not just the cashing in on a major Nazi landmark that troubles opponents In a sense, some argue, the renovation is also fulfilling the Third Reich’s initial plan to turn the colossus into a massive tourism hub In promotional material, developers are praising the original project – whose design is believed to have been chosen by Hitler – as a “world-famous monument” recognised in its day for “award-winning architecture.” Critics say their plans also may wash away many of the elements that provided the reason for preserving the colossus in the first place      “These are not harmless buildings,” said Jürgen Rostock, co-founder for the Prora documentation centre “The original purpose for Hitler was the construction of (a resort) in preparation for the war to come This way of dealing with the building trivialises it and affirms the Nazi regime.”      The facades of some blocks, for instance, are being brightened by dozens of quaint sea-facing balconies, changing the nature of the imposing, austere architecture that stood as a monument to insatiable militarism In addition, the one documentation centre at the site explaining the Big Brother-esque Strength Through Joy program – a Nazi effort to provide affordable fun to workers living the National Socialist dream – may be moved to the fringes of the complex and away from moneyed vacationers or, some fear, abandoned altogether      Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Prora resort is earmarked for redevelopment as holiday apartments, condominiums, a hotel and a spa Photograph: Stefan Sauer/Corbis      Recriminations of the Third Reich are far and wide in modern Germany, with war-era crime history taught from elementary school onward and a pacifist national identity built largely on a rejection of the past The Prora project highlights the always-thorny question here of how to deal with the most tangible relic of Germany’s troubled past: Nazi architecture      In the years after the war, some Nazi-era structures were preserved as monumental testaments to an inhuman regime, while others were pragmatically transformed into offices, army barracks and spaces for other uses The Berlin stadium built for Hitler’s 1936 Olympic Games is now home to the Hertha Berlin soccer club The Detlev-Rohwedder-Haus – former home of Hermann Göring’s Ministry of Aviation – now houses a branch of Germany’s finance ministry      Yet opponents in some circles – particularly historians and Jewish groups – are growing increasingly uncomfortable with projects that smack too much of commercialisation or appear to slight history In Berlin, for instance, a lavish mall opened in September on the site of a former department store whose Jewish owners were dispossessed by the Nazis      “The site has been redeveloped with abundant references to the glorious days of the department store’s best years, but without any display that references the fact that the original owners were forced to relinquish ownership and flee,” said Deidre Berger, director of the American Jewish Committee’s Berlin office      In the mountainous Eifel region of western Germany, meanwhile, a former Nazi training ground is undergoing a $52 million facelift, adding a convention centre and observation deck The facility’s website suggests a blend of historical remembrance and eco-tourism, bluntly stating, “We don’t consider leisure activities and taking a critical look at the history to be irreconcilable.”      After the preservation of so many former Nazi buildings, some argue that enough is enough, saying the time has come to either let them waste away or, in some instances, consider tearing them down Septical historians, for instance, are questioning plans in Nuremberg to spend $100 million on the renovation of the Nazi Party Rally Grounds, where Hitler proudly watched marches of his goose-stepping hordes      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Promotional signs advertise luxury apartments Photograph: Anthony Faiola/Washington Post      “My argument, and the argument of quite a few architectural historians, is: Why renovate such a monument?” said Norbert Frei, a historian at the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena “One could also give it to a controlled decay Leave it as is, and allow what will happen to it to happen It’s in such bad shape that you have to do rather a lot to it It’s almost like building it anew.”      Enter the Colossus of Prora      The project was masterminded in the 1930s by Robert Ley, a top Hitler lieutenant He led the Strength Through Joy effort, which was meant to be a cornerstone of the resort here      At picturesque Prora, thousands of small, heated rooms facing the sea would recharge the minds and bodies of the German masses, preparing vacationers for life as the masters of Europe They would enjoy communal meals and common entertainment areas in the embodiment of Nazi fun      Yet the colossus never lived up to Hitler’s ambitions Despite the importation of forced Polish labour to help build it faster, the resort became a low priority as the second world war raged It was left unfinished and was briefly claimed by the Red Army before being redeveloped into barracks for use by the East German military      After reunification, historic preservationists and other government officials made determinations that the colossus was too expensive and architecturally significant to tear down So the government sold its various blocks to developers A youth hostel opened in part of the complex in 2011 But the complex is now in the midst of a full-blown redevelopment, with the first owners of luxury holiday homes moving in over the summer      Because the property is considered historic, the German government is effectively subsidising sales Prices in the New Prora development, for instance, range from $100,000 to $1.3m But buyers subject to German income tax can receive federal credits worth half the purchase price of a unit      Gerd Grochowiak, managing director of one of the site’s developers, Irisgerd real estate, dismissed critics of the site’s redevelopment, saying he sees nothing wrong with commercialisation there      After all, he said, the structure was “always about tourism, so it doesn’t have such a negative history.”      Stephanie Kirchner also contributed to

he talks about leaving in 2014 In a sense that protects him from an attack from the left, but I would think it has the pernicious effect of softening political support for the existing policy.”      The drop in support for the war among Republican poll respondents mirrors reassessments of the war among the party’s presidential candidates, traditionally more hawkish than Democrats Newt Gingrich declared this month that it was time to leave Afghanistan, while Rick Santorum said that one option would be to withdraw even earlier than the Obama administration’s timeline Mitt Romney has been more equivocal, although he said last summer that it was “time for us to bring our troops home as soon as we possibly can, as soon as our generals think it’s O.K.”      Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box Invalid email address Please re-enter You must select a newsletter to subscribe to Sign Up You will receive emails containing news content , updates and promotions from The New York Times You may opt-out at any time You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services Thank you for subscribing An error has occurred Please try again later View all New York Times newsletters      Michael E O’Hanlon, a military expert at the Brookings Institution who is close to American commanders in Afghanistan, said that the opinion polls reflected a lack of awareness of the current policy, which calls for slowly turning over portions of the country to Afghan security forces, like the southern provinces, where American troops have tamped down the violence      “I honestly believe if more people understood that there is a strategy and intended sequence of events with an end in sight, they would be tolerant,” Mr O’Hanlon said “The overall image of this war is of U.S troops mired in quicksand and getting blown up and arbitrarily waiting until 2014 to come home Of course you’d be against it.”      Among poll respondents, 44 percent said that the United States should withdraw sooner than 2014, while 33 percent said the administration should stick to the current timetable, 17 percent said the United States should stay as long as it would take to stabilize the current situation and 3 percent said the United States should withdraw now ", "summary": "Some 69% of those polled believe the US shouldn't be fighting in Afghanistan, up from 53% just four months ago NATO plans to hand over security to Afghan forces by the end of 2014 But 47% of those polled want the US to leave the country ahead of schedule, and only 17% believe the US should stay for as long as it takes to stabilize the country A military expert at the Brookings Institution blames the poll numbers on a lack of awareness of the US policy of slowly turning parts of the country over to Afghan forces \"The overall image of this war is of US troops mired in quicksand and getting blown up, and arbitrarily waiting until 2014 to come home,\" he says \"Of course you’d be against it.\"", "summary_all": "– American support for the war in Afghanistan has reached an all-time low, according to the latest New York Times/CBS poll Some 69% of those polled believe the US shouldn't be fighting in Afghanistan, up from 53% just four months ago Support has plunged among both Democrats and Republicans, with 68% of Democrats and 60% of Republicans saying the war is going somewhat or very badly, according to the poll, which is consistent with several other recent surveys NATO plans to hand over security to Afghan forces by the end of 2014 But 47% of those polled want the US to leave the country ahead of schedule, and only 17% believe the US should stay for as long as it takes to stabilize the country A military expert at the Brookings Institution blames the poll numbers on a lack of awareness of the US policy of slowly turning parts of the country over to Afghan forces \"The overall image of this war is of US troops mired in quicksand and getting blown up, and arbitrarily waiting until 2014 to come home,\" he says \"Of course you’d be against it.\""}

(Associated Press)      NEW YORK (AP) — The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer      Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged Deep Fried Twinkies starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products      Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan They'll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart      It has a retro cool factor, says Ellen Copaken, Hostess' vice president of marketing It plays into the comfort food trend And it's fun      The Twinkie, long one of Hostess' largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer      For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart      The food lab at the company's Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals      Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier, Redfield said But at the end of the day, it has to taste good Great healthy things that don't taste good don't do well      Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers      At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day      We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content, said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc But there is still room for indulgence      Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company's financial woes had put their future in doubt Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million      U.K expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they're faring better than the deep-fried Oreos      We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo, Papaya chain president Wayne Rosenbaum said The Twinkies seem to be the most popular      Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn't easy The company tested prototypes at its Kansas City, Missouri, headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product Then Wal-Mart approached them Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart's headquarters in Arkansas, came to Wal-Mart, and cooked in the kitchen with them      The original samples were pretty good, said John Pearson, Wal-Mart's senior buyer for frozen foods But the batter was a little lumpy      Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes — with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture      Then there was the name Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie But Pearson and other Wal-Mart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies      When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren't an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants      It's really good It's delicious, said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, New York, who tasted a vanilla cream version      Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn't excited after trying it I like the original Twinkie, she said This is a step too far      What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease We eliminated the hard work and prep, she said      ___      Follow Anne D'Innocenzio on Twitter at

operations for the spy agency      Seven Central Intelligence Agency officers and contractors were killed and six more wounded in the suicide bomb attack at Forward Operating Base Chapman, CIA Director Leon Panetta said Thursday, the second-largest single-day loss for the spy agency in its history      Among the casualties was the agency's base chief, former intelligence officials said There had been only four publicly acknowledged CIA fatalities in Afghanistan prior to this attack      The Taliban claimed responsibility Thursday for the bombing, which was carried out by suicide bomber wearing an Afghan National Army uniform Some senior officials think the bomber may have been given access to the base because he was believed to be an informant, said two former intelligence officials      Several former intelligence officials described the attack in Afghanistan as devastating to the agency A number of the officers killed had been counterterrorism operatives since before the 9/11 attacks The base played a critical role in the CIA's significant operations in the country, including helping with drone attacks and informant networks in Pakistan      The loss of seven officers is significant for a relatively small agency whose workforce is estimated to be 10,000 or more, but it's all the more damaging because those lost represented so much collective experience

missed and not easily regenerated, said Henry A Crumpton, who led the CIA campaign in Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002      The number of casualties in Wednesday's attack was second to those sustained in the Beirut embassy bombing in 1983, which killed eight CIA officers The Beirut bombing hit the agency's Middle East group hard, and was one of the key events that drove the creation of the CIA's Counterterrorist Center a few years later      It will mark this generation the same way Beirut marked mine, said Ron Marks, a 16-year CIA veteran, who left the agency in 1999 With CIA officers deployed to the far reaches of Afghanistan and Pakistan for extended periods, he said, the agency has been lucky to have avoided such attacks for as long as it did      It could also sow mistrust between CIA officers and the Afghan operatives with whom they work closely, another former agency officer said This is a huge blow to the agency It's a close-knit group, the former officer said They're not going to know who to trust now      The base was located in Khost province, a hotbed of militant activity and a stronghold of the Haqqani Network, one of the most hardened and dangerous militant groups, which fought for a decade to wrest the area back from the Russians      The CIA's Khost base was established in the months after the 9/11 attacks as the U.S launched its CIA-led offensive against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan It began as a makeshift center for CIA-Afghan operations By mid-2002, it had grown into a major counterterrorism hub for joint operations with CIA, military Special Operations forces and Afghan allies      The Taliban says it's responsible for two deadly bombings Wednesday, one inside a CIA base and another that killed Canadian troops and a journalist embedded with them Video courtesy of Reuters      Its primary role has been to run informant networks in Afghanistan and over the border, said one former agency official That was one of the bases where they were paying people and running people and sending them into Pakistan, he said      The CIA's activities on the base were an open secret locally, he added, al Qaeda knows it and the townspeople know it and the Taliban know it      The attack in Afghanistan came during an already difficult week for the CIA, which has taken a beating in Washington with President Barack Obama issuing a blunt critique of intelligence failures in advance of the botched Christmas Day terrorist attack      The brazen assault may prompt a re-examination how CIA deploys operatives into dangerous

wrote to CIA employees Thursday to praise the service of officers who were killed      These brave Americans were part of a long line of patriots who have made great sacrifices for their fellow citizens and for our way of life, he wrote Since the Sept 2001 terrorist attacks, he said, because of your service, plots have been disrupted, American lives have been saved, and our Allies and partners have been more secure      The CIA began mobilizing against the perpetrators of the attack The CIA is already working hard to find those who supported the Khost attack, a U.S intelligence official, adding this attack will be avenged through successful, aggressive counterterrorism operations      CIA spokesman George Little said that the attack serves as a reminder of the dangerous nature of the CIA's work There's still a lot to be learned about what happened, he said The key lesson is that counterterrorism work is dangerous Our fallen and wounded colleagues were on the front lines, conducting essential operations to protect our country      On Capitol Hill, the leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees issued statements of condolence      Wednesday's

an officer killed last year, but the officer's name and duties weren't made public      According to a military official who works on Afghan issues, Chapman has grown substantially in recent months and is a base for both military and intelligence operations Because of its size, the officer said, the suicide bomber likely penetrated multiple layers of security before detonating the explosives      Much about the attack at Forward Operating Base Chapman remained uncertain Officials variously said the blast had occurred as the bomber exited a car, or after the bomber had reached the base's gym or its cafeteria      Enlarge Image Close Associated Press A demonstrator in Kabul on Wednesday rallied against a recent U.S.-led attack in Afghanistan that protestors and the Afghan government say killed children NATO disputed the claim      Forward operating bases typically house hundreds of soldiers, and Afghan forces and private contractors also often live on such bases But CIA outposts on these bases are usually small—no more than 15 or maybe 20 people, so 13 casualties is likely a majority of the CIA base personnel, said one former agency official      The attack appeared to be the worst against foreigners since October, when 10 Americans -- seven troops and three civilians -- were killed in a helicopter crash following a firefight with insurgents      It would also mark the first time a suicide bomber managed to strike inside a U.S facility in the country, a sign of the insurgents' growing sophistication Insurgents have been staging increasingly complicated assaults in recent months, including one where a militant infiltrated the country's police force and killed five British soldiers      In a press release Thursday, the Taliban claimed responsibility for the Khost attack The martyr attack was carried out by an Afghan military, Samiullah, when the CIA agents got together in a U.S club-cum-training center for a meeting in order to collect information on the Mujahiodeen, the release said, according to a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute      According to one of the club's guards, the CIA employees, dressed in Afghan uniform were in

That's not racist!”      However, in light of Clint Eastwood's speech at the Republican National Convention, in which he had a largely one-sided conversation with an empty chair he pretended was Barack Obama, this imagery is now associated with the President      The image of the chair is associated with the President Now, lynch that chair from a tree, and you've got a pretty awful racist sentiment calling for lynching the first African-American President!      Lynching was a horrific and commonplace act in Reconstruction-era Texas and continued until the mid-1940's, spurred on by Ku Klux Klan groups Texas is third amongst all states — behind Mississippi and Georgia — in the total number of lynching victims between 1885 and 1942 Of those 468 victims, an overwhelming number were African-American      Perhaps the most well-known and horrific lynching in Texas occurred in 1916, when Jesse Washington was accused of raping and murdering a woman near Waco He was sentenced to death, and lynched in front of a crowd of onlookers, after which members of the mob castrated him, cut off his fingers, and hung him over a bonfire Pieces of his body were sold as souvenirs The gruesome event became part of the NAACP's anti-lynching movement      Most recently, in 1998, James Byrd Jr — for whom the Texas Hate Crimes Prevention Act is named — was lynched by being dragging behind a vehicle in East Texas      We have a sad and awful history of white people lynching African-Americans in Texas, and this history is exactly what this Republican's front yard display taps into      There are folks who will claim that this isn't “racist.” Republicans, especially the Tea Party types, like to claim that liberals think every attack on the President is racist Folks like to claim that hanging a noose up as decoration is “honoring the past of the South,” blithely ignoring the context in which those same nooses were used during the pre-Civil War and Reconstruction eras — by white men to hang African-Americans Some folks will undoubtedly point out the burning of Bush effigies throughout his administration, especially during anti-war protests      This is different This is the specific and deliberate use of a racially charged act of violence — lynching — perpetrated by white men against African-American men and women When you add a Republican symbol for the first African-American President into the mix, you get a pretty awful picture — the one you see at right, and one that can be seen on a front lawn here in leafy, quiet Northwest Austin      We're a state that has a horrific history of hate crimes, and given the new context of the “empty chair” created by the Republican Party during their own convention gives this image of a chair hanging from a tree a decidedly sinister, and yes, racist, meaning      It's awful Republicans should call out this imagery and the racist rhetoric that has come to pervade their party But I'm not holding my breath      Updated 6:28 p.m Wednesday I called the homeowner to ask about his display, citing my concerns as a fellow Austinite He replied, and I quote, “I don't really give a damn whether it disturbs you or not You can take [your concerns]and go straight to hell and take Obama with you I don't give a shit If you don't like it, don't come down my street.”      Ironically, the homeowner in question, Bud Johnson, won “Yard of the Month” in August 2010 from his Homeowners Association I guess his display was a little different that month?

No Obama=Nobama Hahaha In short, this appears to be a crude metaphor for the lynching of President Obama Obviously, it's beyond grotesque (it also boggles my mind that this was allowed to be put up, let alone to stay up, at a festival presumably visited by thousands of people - wtf?) Also, I'm not sure if there's any real connection here, but the chair is right next to a very large Allen for U.S Senate sign that you can't miss Let me just emphasize: I wasn't there, don't know how long the Allen sign was sitting there, who put it there, whether or not they saw the metaphoric lynching tableaux, etc So I definitely don't think we should leap to any conclusions here (even knowing about Allen's extensive history of racist behavior - the noose in his office, the severed deer head in a black man's mailbox, the apparently habitual use of the n word, the infamous photo with the racist Council of Conservative Citizens, the macaca incident, etc., etc.) Anyway, I asked my friend Eric Byler, co-founder of the Coffee Party and director of superb film 9500 Liberty, who did such great work in the northern Viginia Korean-American community (along with his Korean-American partner Annabel Park) in 2006, what he thought of this As always, Eric had some fascinating thoughts, which he told me to feel free to share So, check out the flip for excerpts from our conversation, with bolding added by me for emphasis ", "summary": "", "summary_all": "– An Austin Republican's lawn currently features an empty chair dangling from a rope on a tree, along with a US flag Following Clint Eastwood's RNC speech, it's not a stretch to assume the empty chair symbolizes President Obama, suggesting not-so-subtly a lynching, Burnt Orange Report notes A similar display appeared in Virginia this weekend When Burnt Orange called the Austin man—who in 2010 won a \"Yard of the Month\" award, presumably with a different display—to ask about the chair, he replied, \"I don't really give a damn whether it disturbs you or not You can take (your concerns) and go straight to hell, and take Obama with you If you don't like it, don't come down my street.\""}

{"article_number": 4894, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " When Ruby Tuesday put out the call to employees all over the country for summer workers at its location in Park City, Utah, in 2013, applications came rolling in from far and wide Among those who wanted to apply for the gig with free housing and paid expenses were Oregon employee Andrew Herrera and Missouri employee Joshua Bell But there was a catch: The chain was only hiring women for the jobs to avoid having to figure out coed housing      Bell and Herrera, feeling like they were missing out on more money and work experience, complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission—the federal agency in charge of combating workplace discrimination They claimed the restaurant was discriminating against them because of their gender The EEOC agreed that the men had been unfairy discriminated against because they were men, and some experts and activists are saying that may actually be a good thing for women      On Thursday the agency filed a lawsuit against Ruby Tuesday arguing that the sex-specific hiring practices violated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and “deprived individuals of employment opportunities and otherwise adversely affected their status as internal applicants.”      At first glance it might be tough for anyone who knows how far women still have to go for workplace equality to feel sympathy for these guys—women famously earn much less than men on average, even in traditionally female-dominated fields Some women experience discrimination when they try to take maternity leave Men just out of college with the same degrees and jobs still make more than women, and the higher a woman rises in business, the less likely she is to be paid as much as her male counterparts      But while men aren’t discriminated against nearly as often as women are, they definitely experience workplace harassment and unequal treatment Between 2010 and 2013, men brought more than 16 percent of the sexual harassment charges the EEOC recieved      Fighting these incidents can serve a critical role in protecting all workers from discrimination, especially in jobs such as restaurant work—low-wage employment in which women are often exploited      Making women’s jobs available to men could improve overall labor conditions, too “Jobs constructed as being for women pay less, have fewer promotional opportunities, and often, part of job is to be sexually available to male clients,” said Noah Zatz, a UCLA law professor who specializes in employment and labor law Busting up that single-sex monopoly in waitressing, in-flight service, and nursing, for example, could be a strategy for “disrupting the ways jobs are disadvantageous to women.”      The preeminent case in which men sued to push back against a company hiring only women was a lawsuit three men brought against Hooters, the restaurant chain known for busty waitresses in tank tops and short shorts Though sexy women were at the center of the Hooters image, the company eventually settled with the disgruntled men for $3.75 million in 1997 and agreed to allow men to apply for bartender and host positions      Still, what Ruby Tuesday allegedly did was extreme “It’s rare to see an explicit example of sex discrimination like Ruby Tuesday’s internal job announcement,” EEOC San Francisco Regional Attorney William R Tamayo said in a statement “This suit is a cautionary tale to employers that sex-based employment decisions are rarely justified, and are not consistent with good business judgment.”      Cases like these often rely on “all sorts of stereotypes about who is right for different jobs,” said Fatima Goss Graves, vice president for education and employment at the National Women’s Law Center “Stereotypes that, 50 years after Title VII, we should be beyond.”      When you look at how hiring practices like these could affect women, it’s even easier to understand why this case is significant      “The idea that a company would come up with an outright bar excluding men from applying to a job—if the EEOC didn’t take steps to stop that, what would be next?” Goss Graves asked “Could you have companies who say we’re not going to hire women because this is a job with a lot of gross harassment?”      Or could women be denied employment because the work facility doesn’t have a separate bathroom? Plenty of other work situations could involve living onsite The concern, according to Goss Graves, is that this could be a grounds for discriminatory hiring      “It’s important that the EEOC is taking this type of case and making clear that it’s not OK to set up a structure like this.” she said      We’ve reached out to Ruby Tuesday for comment and will update this story if we hear back ", "summary": "As Take Part explains, the Park City, Utah, location advertised for temporary summer positions in 2013, complete with free housing and paid expenses—and then allegedly only hired women for those positions because the restaurant didn't want to deal with the hassle of coed housing The lawsuit accuses Ruby Tuesday of violating the Civil Rights Act, and the EEOC wants Ruby Tuesday to stop hiring based on gender and to pay losses to Herrera and Bell Despite the fact that the lawsuit was brought on behalf of men, experts tell Take Part it could help to protect all workers from discrimination, plus possibly improve work conditions since, one explains, \"jobs constructed as being for women pay less, have fewer promotional opportunities, and often, part of job is to be sexually available to male clients.\" Adds another, \"The idea that a company would come up with an outright bar excluding men from applying to a job—if the EEOC didn’t take steps to stop that, what would be next?\" (At least one weatherman has also sued for sex discrimination.)", "summary_all": "– An Equal Employment Opportunity Commission attorney calls it \"an unusual lawsuit\"—because you don't often hear about the EEOC suing on behalf of men who say they've been discriminated against But that's what's happening in Eugene, Ore., where such a lawsuit has been filed accusing the Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain of discrimination, the Oregonian reports As Take Part explains, the Park City, Utah, location advertised for temporary summer positions in 2013, complete with free housing and paid expenses—and then allegedly only hired women for those positions because the restaurant didn't want to deal with the hassle of coed housing The EEOC is suing on behalf of Andrew Herrera, who worked at an Oregon Ruby Tuesday, and Joshua Bell, who worked at a Missouri one, both of whom applied for positions The lawsuit accuses Ruby Tuesday of violating the Civil Rights Act, and the EEOC wants Ruby Tuesday to stop hiring based on gender and to pay losses to Herrera and Bell Despite the fact that the lawsuit was brought on behalf of men, experts tell Take Part it could help to protect all workers from discrimination, plus possibly improve work conditions since, one explains, \"jobs constructed as being for women pay less, have fewer promotional opportunities, and often, part of job is to be sexually available to male clients.\" Adds another, \"The idea that a company would come up with an outright bar excluding men from applying to a job—if the EEOC didn’t take steps to stop that, what would be next?\" (At least one weatherman has also sued for sex discrimination.)"}

{"article_number": 617, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "VOL 128 | NO 250 | Tuesday, December 24, 2013      Since August, Memphis City Council members have been reviewing the numbers Asking questions about them Verifying them Categorizing them      It is the other numbers discussion at City Hall these days – the one about how many rape kits city agencies took on sexual assault victims that the Memphis Police Department never processed over a period of approximately 30 years      And with the filing of a lawsuit Friday, Dec 20, in the U.S District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, there will almost certainly be new numbers to come And there will be renewed questions that have taken a back seat at City Hall to the details of clearing the backlog      The lawsuit filed by a Jane Doe sexual assault victim from 2001 against the city of Memphis is about how it happened      The premise of the lawsuit is that it was no accident or mistake      The lawsuit, filed by attorney Robert Spence, alleges Memphis Police Department brass knew Jane Doe’s rape kit – and maybe as many as 15,000 others – were not being tested and that the practice was “ratified by multiple policymakers within the city of Memphis Police Department.”      “Defendant has a history of discriminating against females,” the lawsuit continues “Defendant treats domestic violence abuse reports from women with less priority than other crimes not involving women reporting domestic violence abuse.”      It also claims the city “knew about the herein described conduct and facilitated it, approved it, condoned it and/or turned a blind eye to it.”      The lawsuit alleges the lack of processing of the rape kits violates the equal protection clause of the U.S Constitution, and it seeks class-action status for a group of victims that could number more than 15,000      The lawsuit’s estimate is based on the number of sexual assault and rape victims who made reports to third-party agencies during the time covered by the backlog, had rape kits done as part of their cases and who were then turned over to police for further investigation      The council committee sessions are the only consistent view the public has had of the problem Council members, early in their discussions, called for monthly progress reports on how many kits had been processed and how many showed indications of enough evidence to warrant further testing      It’s also where the first public indications have been found of how long clearing the backlog will take and how much it will cost the city      When the council focused its attention on the problem in August, the first committee session included plenty of questions about how this could have happened      Council member Janis Fullilove was aggressive in her questioning about who specifically was responsible She pushed Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong for answers, while acknowledging that the problem began long before he became police director Armstrong repeatedly said he didn’t know The council’s discussion shifted to how to clear the backlog      In August, Armstrong wasn’t making even a general estimate on the number of rape kits, putting it at “several thousand.”      As the lawsuit gets into the discovery stage, he and other top police brass will be pushed for more specific and definitive answers, not only about how it happened but what the procedures were for handling the rape kits and who was responsible for enforcing those procedures      Armstrong told council members last week he will need an additional $396,000 or will have to find that amount within his existing division budget just to address further processing of the initial group      The backlog, according to Armstrong, stands at more than 12,000, with an initial batch of 1,600 still being processed He is putting them in groups of 400 each, with the idea that that is about as many as multiple independent labs can each handle      So far, three-fourths of the kits that have been processed have shown some kind of results that require additional processing That’s more than Armstrong initially estimated His first estimate was that about half would come back with some indications that would prompt further testing      Memphis Mayor A C Wharton Jr said the city is applying for state and federal grants to help pay the cost of processing the backlog      The administration is also trying to track down a letter reportedly sent by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation that resulted in some rape kits being sent to that state agency      City Chief Administrative Officer George Little estimated processing the entire backlog will take “several years.”      The Memphis Police Department also has plans to build a center with a laboratory specifically for testing and processing such rape kits ", "summary": "In many cases, the kits spoiled while waiting for testing The city, the lawsuit alleges, \"has a history of

in what is now Turkey The piece could help scientists recreate early humans' migrations from Africa      This discovery is critical for establishing the timing and route of early human dispersal into

from Turkey ever recorded and was dropped on the floodplain by an early hominin well over a million years ago      Ancient intelligence      Stone tools are some of the longest-lasting evidence of ancient human culture, and their workmanship can reveal much about the intelligence and lifestyle of human ancestors The oldest stone tools are about 2.6 million years old, and the style of their workmanship is called Oldowan, after the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania where they were found, according to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History Later, about 1.7 million years ago, ancient hominins such as Homo erectus began making more sophisticated tools, such as hand axes, scrapers and flaked tools [Denisovan Gallery: Tracing the Genetics of Human Ancestors]      Although many flaked tools have been discovered in Turkey, most were in sediments that couldn't be reliably dated      The new finding comes after Schreve and her colleagues began taking a second look at the Gediz valley, where other artifacts had been discovered One site where the researchers looked was a place where an ancient river twisted slightly,      The flake was an incredibly exciting find, Schreve said I had been studying the sediments in the meander bend and my eye was drawn to a pinkish stone on the surface When I turned it over for a better look, the features of a humanly-struck artifact were immediately apparent      The team analyzed the ratio of Argon isotopes (atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons) in lava flows that periodically crept into the valleys of the region They also looked at the compass orientation of the magnetic minerals within the regions' rocks At different times in Earth's history, the poles have wandered, so the orientation of those minerals can reflect the location of the poles at the time      By combining these two measurements, the team estimated that the stone tool they found was between 1.17 and 1.24 million years old The only other contemporaneous evidence of Homo erectus inhabitance in the region is an ancient skull that was uncovered in Kocabaş, Turkey, whose age is uncertain A recent study suggested the skull is between 1.1 and 1.3 million years old, although early estimates have put the fossil at just 500,000 years old, according to a March 2014 study in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters      By providing

(Associated Press)      The 67-year-old grandmother took one sip before spitting it out and exclaiming to her husband: I think I just drank acid      In fact, the tea was laced with a highly toxic industrial cleaning solution meant for degreasing deep fryers, authorities said It contained the odorless chemical lye, the active ingredient in drain cleaners      Four days later, Harding was in critical condition Thursday at a Salt Lake City hospital's burn unit, unable to talk and fighting for her life, lawyer Paxton Guymon said She hasn't improved since Sunday, when she and her husband went to Dickey's Barbecue Pit in South Jordan after church      Investigators and the restaurant manager have told the Hardings that a worker mistook the cleaning product for sugar and accidentally mixed large quantities of it into the iced-tea dispenser, Guymon said      It's disturbing that this kind of toxic, poisonous material would be in the food-prep area and somehow find its way into the iced tea vat, Guymon said I don't know how something like that can happen      South Jordan police are still investigating how the chemical ended up in the sweet-tea container, but they think it was

the country in the Dallas-based chain      Guymon said he will wait for the police investigation to finish before determining what legal action to take      The chemical, also known as sodium hydroxide, comes in both liquid and powder form The one the worker added to the tea was a powder, Guymon said      The chemical also is in products such as Drano, said Tom Richmond, professor of chemistry at the University of Utah It would start dissolving your insides, he said      Doctors are trying to determine if it caused any tears in Harding's esophagus or stomach, Guymon said The woman

On Wednesday afternoon, Wilmington police received a 911 call about a man in a wheelchair with a self-inflicted wound      A witness on the scene shot a cellphone video showing one officer pointing a shotgun or a rifle at the man in the wheelchair, screaming at him “drop the gun” and “hands up.”      The man in the wheelchair appears to be bleeding Three more officers, with handguns drawn, appear on the scene and scream at him to drop the gun      The man fidgets, moving his legs with his hands, rubbing his knees with both hands, trying to raise himself out of the wheelchair      Then he slides his hand up his thigh toward his waist and officers open fire Several shots ring out For a moment, the man in the wheelchair freezes, then falls sideways onto the ground Motionless      No gun is visible in the video, which was posted on YouTube      WARNING: Graphic video      On Thursday, a day after the shooting, Police Chief Bobby Cummings said Jeremy “Bam” McDole was armed and reaching for a weapon      McDole’s family, at a gathering about an hour before the city’s press conference, disputed those findings and called for a federal investigation McDole’s mother, Phyllis, said her son did not have a weapon and would never harm himself      “This was murder,” she said “He shot my son like he was roadkill.”      Cummings said officers responded to a 911 call at 3 p.m Wednesday about a man with a self-inflicted gunshot wound who was armed in the 1800 block of Lancaster Avenue      When officers arrived, he said, they located the man in the 1800 block of Tulip Street, where they repeatedly told him to put down his weapon and raise his arms      McDole, 28, did not comply and reached for his waistband for a handgun, Cummings said When McDole began to remove the gun, four officers opened fire The chief said police found a .38 caliber gun at McDole’s side      Cummings would not divulge the names or race of the officers involved in the shooting, or if any had any prior encounters with McDole      The four officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave      “I’m sorry for the officers and family of Mr McDole, as this encounter unfortunately ended with the loss of his life,” said Cummings “I know that this incident could impact police and community relations, therefore, I will ensure a thorough and transparent investigation will be conducted.”      The city police department has been working to improve relations with its residents in the past year Officers get sensitivity training and recruits are taught about cultural diversity      The state Justice Department’s Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust is investigating the shooting, said spokesman Carl Kanefsky, which is policy any time a police officer fires a weapon that injures or kills someone      Local activist Keith James, who helped plan local rallies following acts of police brutality across the country, said for once, he’s standing on the side of police      James, who is president of Voices 4 the Voiceless and a member of the Citizen Advisory Council for the Wilmington Police Department, believes the shooting was justified after watching cell phone video posted online and said officers were in a dangerous situation      “From what I see, they handled it in a justified manner,” he said “If he didn’t have a weapon, that would be a whole different story.”      Noting his history with activism, he said he would be the first person to criticize city police officers for doing something wrong, as he’s done in the past But this time, he’s confident in the work of local law enforcement      At a vigil for McDole Thursday night, mourners spelled out “RIP BAM” in tea lights in front of his mother’s home Many came to pay their respects to the man they believe was unjustly killed      About 30 relatives and friends also gathered at the scene of the shooting Thursday morning to mourn McDole Most were angry at police for what they say was an unjustified use of force A few placed flowers or candles nearby      Relatives gathered later at McDole’s mother’s home on North Rodney Street where they disputed the police account      “He wasn’t bothering anybody He didn’t have a weapon or anything,” said Phyllis McDole “He stood up and pulled his pants up and sat back down and put his hands on his lap and they opened fire on him.”      “They shot my son so much he fell out of the wheelchair,” she said breaking into tears “He fell out the chair and on the ground He wasn’t armed He didn’t have a gun He died by himself He died alone.”      McDole, a skinny woman with a big voice and carefully tied braids around the crown of her head, said her son was a happy man who loved spending time with family, especially his nephew      CLOSE Skip

tomorrow when he doesn’t come to take him to get a water ice?”      McDole added that she doesn’t have the financial means to bury her son and asked for anyone who might be able to help financially to reach out      As Mayor Dennis P Williams was explaining later at the city press conference that the family will be kept in the loop every step of the way, Phyllis McDole stood up from the crowd and demanded answers now      She then went to the podium and Williams stepped aside      “This was an injustice,” she said      State NAACP President Richard Smith also spoke, calling for an independent investigation from outside officials He said police officers can’t be investigating police officers in the same city      Smith said his group arranged for McDole’s family to meet Thursday with civil rights attorneys from Delaware At this point, the city and the state need closure, Smith said      “We can’t treat poor folks the way we’ve been treating them,” he said “They have a right to live They have a right to breathe.”      McDole was paralyzed from the waist down after he was shot in the back about 10 years ago and was living at the Hillside Center nursing home on the 800 block of South Broom Street, according to McDole’s great uncle, Vincent Smith      “We want justice for my brother,” Ashley Morrison-Wright, 23, of Wilmington, said Thursday “This isn’t right.”      Her brother spent a lot of time with family members, especially his grandparents, who lived near his home in Wilmington, she said      “He was a very, very sweet man,” Morrison-Wright said His sister said McDole never owned a gun      Neighborhood reaction      Buy Photo (Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER/THE NEWS JOURNAL)      The shooting and video elicited strong reaction in the community and on social media      “The mayor’s office and police department is aware of the video footage,” city spokeswoman Alexandra Coppadge said, “and will continue to conduct a thorough investigation of the officer-involved shooting.”      Anthony Slaughter is a friend and mentor to McDole who said he met with him just a few days before his death      “It is very disturbing – the footage,” he said “He wasn’t doing anything in a violent motion If there was a gun, it would have fallen to the ground when he fell There was no gun.”      Slaughter and others gathered Thursday morning said they don’t have faith that an investigation by the state will bring justice      “In a situation like this, the police shouldn’t be investigating themselves,” Slaughter said      Merrell Watson said he passed by McDole on the street shortly before the shooting      “He wasn’t doing anything violent,” Watson said “I honestly feel that officers abused their privilege They are supposed to protect and serve, and they didn’t do that.”      Esteban Parra and Jessica Masulli Reyes contributed to this story Contact robin brown at rbrown@delawareonline.com, Jenna Pizzi at jpizzi@delawareonline.com and Brittany Horn at

the entire shipment associated with that sample was denied entry into the U.S The two others had less than 23 ppb inorganic arsenic FDA says four of the samples that did not undergo further testing were collected before the agency established its level of concern for inorganic arsenic in ready-to-drink apple juice, and that it is “currently determining what action was taken” regarding the remaining sample      When those eight test results were added to the previous 70 samples plus results for another 82 samples the agency collected in the latter part of 2011, the cumulative total posted on FDA’s website rose to 160 Of those, 12 percent had 10 ppb or higher total arsenic and 5 percent had arsenic levels of 23 ppb or higher      The FDA also cites test results of samples in its Total Diet Study program, which tested another 134 composite apple juice samples from 1991 to 2009 Of those, nearly a quarter tested at 10 ppb or higher and 5 percent had 23 ppb or more of total arsenic The overall picture is that the vast majority of apple juice samples tested below the FDA’s 23 ppb level of concern, an FDA spokeswoman said      But the level the FDA deems acceptable should be much lower, Consumers Union believes, because in establishing its level of concern the agency didn’t consider the risks of skin, lung, and bladder cancer that arsenic exposure poses to the public ", "summary": "– Apple juice and grape juice have levels of arsenic that could raise kids' risk of cancer, according to an investigation by Consumer Reports The study of 88 samples of fruit juice bought in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut found that 10% had arsenic levels that exceeded standards set for federal drinking water In addition, 25% exceeded the levels of lead deemed safe for bottled water The advocacy arm of the group, Consumers Union, called on the FDA to set safety levels for fruit juices given how many kids drink them", "summary_all": "– Apple juice and grape juice have levels of arsenic that could raise kids' risk of cancer, according to an investigation by Consumer Reports The study of 88 samples of fruit juice bought in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut found that 10% had arsenic levels that exceeded standards set for federal drinking water In addition, 25% exceeded the levels of lead deemed safe for bottled water The advocacy arm of the group, Consumers Union, called on the FDA to set safety levels for fruit juices given how many kids drink them “What we’re talking about here is not about acute affects,” one CR scientist tells NBC “We’re talking about chronic effects We’re talking about cancer risk.\" In response to the study, the FDA said it remains confident in the safety of fruit juices but added that it \"has expanded our surveillance activities and is collecting additional data.\""}

age of 16, in the latest controversy over the technology giant's manufacturing methods      An internal audit found a flipside to the western consumer's insatiable thirst for innovative and competitively priced gadgets It uncovered 106 cases of underage labour being used at Apple suppliers last year and 70 cases historically The report follows a series of worker suicides over working conditions at Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that assembles must-have products such as the iPad and iPhone, and lethal explosions at other plants      Apple's annual supplier report – which monitors nearly 400 suppliers – found that children were employed at 11 factories involved in making its products A number of them had been recruited using forged identity papers      The report uncovered a catalogue of other offences, ranging from mandatory pregnancy tests, to bonded workers whose wages are confiscated to pay off debts imposed by recruitment agencies They also found cases of juveniles being used to lift heavy goods, workers having their wages docked as a punishment and one factory dumping waste oil in the toilets      One Chinese supplier, a circuit board component maker called Guangdong Real Faith Pingzhou Electronics, was axed by Apple after 74 children under the age of 16 were recruited to work on its production lines According to Apple, the children had been knowingly supplied by one of the region's largest labour agencies, Shenzhen Quanshun Human Resources Its investigators found that the agency conspired with families to forge identification documents Apple did not disclose the ages of the children involved, but its code of conduct states it will not employ workers under the age of 15, or under the legal working age in any jurisdiction – which is 16 in China      Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, who in a previous role was responsible for building Apple's supply chain, has been under pressure to push through changes after the suicides at Foxconn, whose manufacturing operations are largely based in China Last September a brawl involving up to 2,000 workers forced Foxconn to close a plant in northern China      Last year he described the use of underage labour as abhorrent, saying it was extremely rare in our supply chain, and stepped up measures to weed out bad practice including hiring an independent auditor, the Fair Labor Association      Underage labour is a subject no company wants to be associated with, so as a result I don't believe it gets the attention it deserves, and as a result it doesn't get fixed like it should, said Jeff Williams, senior vice president of operations at Apple He vowed to eradicate the practice, but said it could take some time      At Pingzhou, the children were returned to their families and the employer was required to pay expenses to facilitate their successful return Although 95% of the facilities scrutinised by Apple complied with child labour laws, transgressors were told to return minors to a school chosen by their family, pay for their education, and give them an income equal to their factory wages      Bonded labour was discovered at eight factories In order to find work, some foreign labourers pay fees to a string of recruitment agencies and sub-agencies, amassing huge debts Their wages are then automatically handed over to pay the debts, tying them to jobs until the balance has been paid off      Apple ordered its suppliers to reimburse excessive recruitment fees – anything higher than one month's wages – and said $6.4m (£4m) was handed back to contract workers in 2012      Investigators found 90 facilities that deducted wages to punish workers, prompting Apple to order the reimbursement of employees Mandatory pregnancy testing was found at 34 places of work, while 25 tested for medical conditions such as hepatitis B At four facilities, payroll records were falsified to hide information from auditors, and at one, a supplier was found intentionally

{"article_number": 2156, "article_idx": 2, "article_text": " Portland Community College, a public college that serves 90,000 students calls itself the largest secondary education institution in Oregon, is staging a “Whiteness History Month” plainly designed to convince white students to despise themselves and their culture That’s not how the PCC website puts it, of course:      Whiteness History Month: Context, Consequences and Change is a multidisciplinary, district-wide, educational project examining race and racism through an exploration of the construction of whiteness, its origins and heritage Scheduled for the month of April 2016, the project seeks to inspire innovative and practical solutions to community issues and social problems that stem from racism      More:      Whiteness History Month Project, unlike heritage months, is not a celebratory endeavor, it is an effort to change our campus climate The Project seeks to challenge the master narrative of race and racism through an exploration of the social construction of whiteness Challenging the master narrative of traditional curriculum is a strategy within higher education that promotes multicultural education and equity      These people truly put the “PC” in “PCC” According to the college’s demographics page, two-thirds of its students are white Most of them are older than age 25 It’s hard to say for sure, but I’m betting the school’s student population is chiefly white and working class — who, as we all know from our progressive catechism, are the Worst People In The World      Victor Tan Chen, writing in The Atlantic, may be in need of re-education at Portland Community College From his piece, which pivots from the startling study by Anne Case and Angus Deaton showing that white working class people are dying at extraordinarily high rates, usually from drugs, alcoholism, or suicide VTC continues:      Any explanation of the ominous trends in the Case and Deaton study is, at the moment, speculative More research is needed, as social scientists like to say, and there are numerous caveats For example, while the disappearance of high-paying jobs for those with little education is a large part of the overall story of a shrinking middle class, it can’t wholly account for the uptick of mortality identified in the Case and Deaton study After all, other countries have not seen similar hikes in deaths, even though manufacturing and (to a lesser extent) unionmembership have crumbled abroad as well Likewise, the groups that have been affected most viciously by these market trends in the U.S., African Americans and Latinos, have not suffered the dramatic increases in death by suicide or substance abuse that whites have It may be that changes in the economy have affected these workers in different ways For instance, whites are more likely to be employed in the declining manufacturing sector than African Americans or Hispanics—and for that matter, they’re morelikely to live in the rural communities devastated by this most recent, post-NAFTA era of deindustrialization Furthermore, whites are less likely to be union members than African Americans (though not Asians or Hispanics)      Yet there is clearly more to the despair of the working class than empty wallets and purses Patches of the social fabric that once supported them, in good times and bad, have frayed When asked in national surveys about the people with whom they discussed “important matters” in the past six months, those with just a high-school education or less are likelier to say no one (this percentage has risen over the years for college graduates, too) This trend is troubling, given that social isolation is linked to depression and, in turn, suicide and substance abuse One form of social support that many in the working class are going without is marriage I’m reminded of another worker I interviewed, a jobless 54-year-old white woman who used to work at a Ford plant Her husband left her, she says, when the paychecks stopped coming “Jesus Christ,” she told him once “I didn’t think that our relationship was based on the amount of money that I brought in.” Unable to pay her mortgage, she lost her home and had to move in, as she puts it, with a “man friend.” She is depressed, unable to sleep at night, and constantly worried about falling into poverty “I’m a loser,” she says      Yet the progressives at Portland Community College are making it their business to educate people from this demographic in their own guilt and vileness      These nitwit progressives have no idea, no idea at all, what kind of demons they are calling up If our economy were to collapse, America would start to look something like the old Yugoslavia in its fracturing Middle-class progressives at places like Portland Community College will have a lot to answer for This is a time in which they could do a lot of good promoting community solidarity, especially among those of all races who are being left behind by this economy But they won’t, because waging racist culture war is too important to them      (Via Campus Reform.)

I have two (white) sons at PCC They don’t have any patience for that kind of politically correct stuff (they’re too busy studying and working), and say that the same attitude is shared by most of their classmates In fact, they weren’t even aware of “whiteness history month.” A month ago, I discussed with my youngest son the upheaval that was happening on certain college campuses over racial issues (demonstrations, occupations, intimidation, demands, etc.) He said nothing of the kind was happening at PCC Although there were a few profs and students who mouthed PC slogans, there was no disruption of the educational process No demonstrations or such As my youngest son said “Dad, most PCC students are taking a full course load PLUS working at least one job, with long commutes We just don’t have any time for that other stuff….” So my take is this: yes, the “whiteness” event is kooky and to be criticized But don’t write off this school on that account My sons are getting excellent educations, at an unbeatable price One is in the EMT/Paramedic program, and the other is getting his AA and then transferring to a four-year university in pursuit of a liberal arts degree in the humanities (in fact, he’s almost certainly going to end up getting an MA or even a Ph.D.) PCC has been a godsend Up until four years ago, we lived a block from PCC, and on my commute home from work I rode the bus with PCC students every day Generally speaking, they were a very impressive bunch of kids: serious, focused, working hard at their studies I often talked with them about their classes and career goals      Oh, I’m not surprised about the student body I wish, though, someone would speak out against this racialist garbage It would be interesting to see what the student body did with the knowledge that the administration of their college thinks they need to be re-educated to understand why they are bad because of the color of their skin ", "summary": "\"At Portland Community College, evidence from hiring data, student-­led research, surveys, focus groups, college-wide emails, and other sources have illuminated the underlying reality of whiteness embedded in the overall college climate\" USA Today reports Whiteness History Month is predictably drawing criticism from certain circles", "summary_all": "– April is Whiteness History Month at Oregon's Portland Community College, NBC News reports But instead of dissertations on the Tea Party, juice cleanses, and Macklemore, Whiteness History Month will attempt to \"challenge the master narrative of race and racism through an exploration of the social construction of whiteness,\" per the event's website NBC reports Whiteness History Month was created by the college's diversity council to improve the culture of a campus that is 68% white \"Colleges across the country continue to struggle to improve diversity, inclusion, and racial equity,\" the website states \"At Portland Community College, evidence from hiring data, student-­led research, surveys, focus groups, college-wide emails, and other sources have illuminated the underlying reality of whiteness embedded in the overall college climate\" USA Today reports Whiteness History Month is predictably drawing criticism from certain circles The American Conservative calls it \"hate whitey month,\" and Right Wing News claims it's an effort to shame white people for their \"disproportionate\" accomplishments In a statement, Portland Community College interim president Sylvia Kelley says Whiteness History Month isn't trying to \"shame or blame\" anyone \"We view this project as part of a larger national conversation around race and social justice on America’s college campuses,\" she says According to the event's website, it's currently looking for lectures, plays, and more to accomplish its goals of understanding whiteness, how it can be done away with, and what can replace it."}

museum, or in fact their beheading of the beloved, and heroic, Syrian antiquities director Dr Khalid al-Asaad The latest atrocity, the Temple of Bel in Palmyra, from 32 B.C., and arguably one of the most important ruins in the Middle East, was blown up in the last few days, according to UN satellite imagery Recently, a most welcome academic, high-tech form of resistance to the destruction has been staged by England's Institute of Digital Archaelogy, based in Oxford      The researchers of the Institute, funded by Harvard University and the Classical Conclaves–including Oxford University–have been working on a plan to flood the artifact-laden zones of Iraq and Syria now nominally under Isis control with 5000-to-10,000 digital mapping cameras The notion is to map the

Michel's race against time matters to everybody on the planet, and, the glad news is that it isn't just restricted to Syria and Iraq–it's region-wide, encompassing Lebanon, Turkey, Iran, and Yemen, most of which have their own arenas of conflict and thus pose their own dangers As for Syria and Iraq, sending people out to record endangered cultural assets in Isis' hotly-contested patchwork of micro-regions will be tough in several ways The Institute's citizen-filmmakers will be a certainly brave but very loose confederation of people from local museums, NGOs, and government organizations, and possibly even some former colleagues of the deeply-mourned and globally admired Dr Asaad      But we all know how war works The Insitute of Digital Archaeology is going directly after one of Isis' main propaganda prizes, the treasure that Isis wants to be seen destroyingin the secular world's eyes, that the masters of Isis want most to be seen destroying, namely, the recorded narrative of

Cromartie Memorial car park in Dingwall uncovered evidence of a mound that archaeologists believe was established in the 11th century as a gathering spot for a Viking parliament, known as a “Thing”      Picture: Contributed      When it was constructed the “Thing” would have been on a man-made islet in the estuary of the River Pefferey, historians claimed They believe the mound was built on the instructions of Thorfinn the Mighty, a powerful Viking earl who died in 1065      He is thought to have laid the foundations of what would later become the royal burgh of Dingwall in Ross-shire      It is only the second time a “Thing” site has been uncovered in the UK Yesterday historians said the discovery would help them learn more about the Norse Vikings, who battled for control of land across the north of Scotland      David MacDonald, of Dingwall History Society, which was part of the dig partnership, said that a road, a ditch and an aqueduct, known as the Water of Dyke, that drew water from hillside springs, were also constructed when Thorfinn was in control of Ross-shire      He said Thorfinn’s rise to power was aided by his victory in a battle at Torfnes on the south side of the Cromarty Firth, possibly against MacBeth’s troops At the height of his power, Thorfinn became Lord of Caithness, Shetland and Orkney      The origins of the town of Dingwall as a Viking Thing-site had long puzzled historians and archaeologists alike, with many believing it was elsewhere on the Black Isle in Ross-shire      But now the results of the archaeological dig, the culmination of Highland Council’s participation as a partner in the EU Northern Periphery International Thing Project, has come up with real answers      Mr MacDonald said: “You can call this the official confirmation of the car park being the location of a ‘Thing’      “It has been very exciting over the years, but all the historical research points in this direction.”      In recent times historical investigation identified the Cromartie car park – which contains the burial place and memorial monument of George, first earl of Cromartie, who died in 1714 – as the site of the long lost Moothill of Dingwall, the town’s medieval meeting place This has now been confirmed as deriving from the Viking Thing-mound      A trial trench excavation in the car park in 2012 showed significant radio-carbon datings      According to archaeologist Dr Oliver O’Grady, a leading authority on the assembly mounds of Scotland, who was part of the dig : “The excavations have confirmed the presence of important archaeological remains and indicated that the mound was man-made and probably created during the 11th century      “The radio-carbon datings provide strong scientific evidence to support the interpretation that the mound was created during the period of late Norwegian political influence in Ross-shire and wider North-east Scotland      “The lack of substantial occupation remains or burial activity is also further circumstantial evidence that the mound was created for an assembly site or Thing      “The substantial manpower and effort required to create a monument on the scale of the Dingwall mound would also seem in keeping with the establishment of a major regional judicial and administrative centre.”      Dingwall, which lies at the head of the Cromarty Firth, is a location on

definitive diagnoses died with him, historians have speculated that Beethoven, who died, deaf, at 56, suffered from medical conditions including alcohol-induced cirrhosis, lead poisoning and syphilis            Beethoven's heart was found structurally sound upon autopsy in 1827 But in an article published recently in the journal Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, the authors — a cardiologist, an internal medicine specialist and a musicologist — cite the rhythmic turnabouts in three of the master's compositions to diagnose an irregular heartbeat      What is clear from his personal letters and notes is that Beethoven began to lose his hearing around 1800, at the age of 30 He composed the bulk of his music even as the sounds of the world around him dimmed — and that, say the authors of the new study, may have made him exquisitely attuned to his own heartbeat Some of his most haunting and ambitious works — the late string quartets, the Mass in D minor (Missa solemnis), the Ninth Symphony in D minor — were composed after he became completely deaf in 1819            “This is entirely speculative,” said Dr Zachary D Goldberger of the University of Washington, the cardiologist on the team “At least it gives us a new dimension by which to listen to his music.”      Goldberger said he and his coauthors focused on the rhythmic shifts and punctuations of three Beethoven compositions: the Piano Sonata in E flat major (Opus 81a, called “Les Adieux”), the String Quartet No 13 in B flat major (Opus 130) and the Piano Sonata No 31 in A flat major (Opus 110) These works have been characterized by musicologists as particularly abrupt, dramatic or unusual in music of Beethoven's time            The authors note the “distinctive ‘galloping' rhythm” of the Sonata in E flat major's adagio section and hear slow, irregular heartbeats, followed by “racing irregular heartbeats,” in the allegro section that follows      In the String Quartet No 13, the authors hear, in a seven-measure section in the middle of the fifth movement (the “Cavatina”), “a short paroxysm of an atrial tachyarrhythmia.” They cite Beethoven's notation: that the passage should be played “beklemmt,” or “heavy of heart.” And they note the 2011 observation by pianist Jonathan Biss that the section always evoked a sensation of shortness of breath            In the third movement of the Piano Sonata No 31 in A flat major, the authors point to an “arioso dolente“ (or lamenting song) preceding one of two fugues The left hand plays a repetitive run of notes that “bears some resemblance to rapid tachyarrhythmia,” they write The right hand, simultaneously, plays an irregularly punctuated melody that “bears some resemblance to dyspnea,” or shortness of breath, “which would not be an unusual sensation for someone experiencing a tachyarrhythmia.”      “When your heart beats irregularly from heart disease, it does so in some predictable patterns,” said Dr Joel D Howell of the University of Michigan, the team's internist (who also has a PhD in the history and sociology of science) “We think we hear some of those same patterns in his music.”      Beethoven's litany of physical woes clearly predisposed him to atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or even multifocal atrial tachycardia, Goldberger, Howell and University of Michigan musicologist Steven M Whiting wrote in the paper But they acknowledged that their observations are far from proof of those conditions: “Similar rhythmic intricacies” are found in other works by many composers, and cardiac arrhythmia can hardly be ascribed to all who use irregular syncopation      “However, in highly charged passages of certain pieces, the possibility of cardiac arrhythmia can lend a quite physical aspect to one's interpretation of the music in question,” they wrote “These passages can seem, in an unexpectedly literal sense, to be heartfelt.”      Follow me on Twitter @LATMelissaHealy and like Los Angeles Times

In his directions for playing the piece, Beethoven uses the German word beklemmt to indicate heavy of heart The authors suggest that while heavy of heart could be taken to mean sadness, in a more literal sense it could mean a feeling of pressure, which is associated with heart disease      The team also spotted arrhythmic patterns in some of Beethoven's other pieces They found them in the Piano Sonata in A-flat major, Opus 110, and the opening of the Les Adieux Sonata opus 81a in E-flat major, which Beethoven wrote during Napoleon's attack on Vienna in 1809      Prof Goldberger comments:      While these musical arrhythmias may simply manifest Beethoven's genius, there is a possibility that in certain pieces his beating heart could literally be at the heart of some of the greatest masterpieces of all time      In August 2014, Medical News Today reported how increasing the amount or intensity of exercise can decrease risks of developing arrhythmia This was the conclusion of a Stanford-led study of older women that found, compared with the least active, the most physically active women had a 10% lower risk of developing atrial fibrillation - a heart condition that causes arrhythmia And this was true even if the women were obese ", "summary": "\"While these musical arrhythmias may simply manifest Beethoven's genius, there is a possibility that in certain pieces his beating heart could literally be at the heart of some of the greatest masterpieces of all time,\" Goldberger says, per Medical News Today", "summary_all": "– As Beethoven went deaf, he may have started listening to his heart In a new study published in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, a cardiologist, an internal medical specialist, and a musicologist point out that three of the German composer's works exhibit \"rhythmic shifts and punctuations\" that weren't typical of music during his time but that closely resemble various forms of heart arrhythmia Although the Los Angeles Times notes that Beethoven's heart was found \"structurally sound\" in an autopsy, no one knows for sure what medical conditions he suffered from The study analyzed Beethoven's Piano Sonata in E flat major, the String Quartet No 13 in B flat major, and the Piano Sonata No 12 in A flat major In the first sonata, researchers noticed a \"distinctive 'galloping' rhythm\" in one section, and another section evoking irregular heartbeats both slow and fast; in the string quartet, the \"shortness of breath\" evoked is like a \"short paroxysm of an atrial tachyarrhythmia\"; and in the second sonata, a \"repetitive run of notes … 'bears some resemblance to rapid tachyarrhythmia.'\" In what co-author Zachary Goldberger acknowledges is \"entirely speculative,\" they theorize as Beethoven went deaf, he may have become more \"attuned\" to his heartbeat, though they admit \"similar rhythmic intricacies\" are present in other musicians' compositions \"While these musical arrhythmias may simply manifest Beethoven's genius, there is a possibility that in certain pieces his beating heart could literally be at the heart of some of the greatest masterpieces of all time,\" Goldberger says, per Medical News Today (A music teacher recreated a Beethoven piece lost for 200 years.)"}

I would have at least beaten the crap out of Harvey if I had heard that.” Rose said they didn’t know what to do She confided that a female attorney had told her that because she had done nudity in movies that no jury would believe her and that it would turn into a he said/she said case      Rose told me that all she could do at the time was to get Harvey Weinstein to donate money to an abused women’s shelter and in return she had to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that forbade her from talking about the horrific violation without being sued, and that she shouldn’t even be telling me To add insult to injury, she told me that she was blacklisted from even auditioning for any Weinstein movies      Incensed at what I heard, I told Rose that she was not blacklisted from MY movies and that Harvey couldn’t tell me who to cast The reason was that Harvey didn’t work on my movies, I made movies all those years for Dimension and Bob Weinstein So I explained that if I cast her in my next film, Harvey couldn’t suddenly tell me no, because my first question would be “Oh, really? Why can’t I cast her?” And I was sure he would not want to tell me why      I then revealed to Rose right then and there that I was about to start writing a movie with Quentin Tarantino, a double feature throwback to 70’s exploitation movies, and that if she was interested, I would write her a BAD ASS character and make her one of the leads I wanted her to have a starring role in a big movie to take her OFF the blacklist, and the best part is that we would have Harvey’s new Weinstein Company pay for the whole damn thing      Just as I finished telling Rose this, I saw Harvey walking around the party! I called Harvey over to our table, and as soon as he got close enough to see that I was sitting with Rose, his face dropped and went ghostly white I said, “Hey Harvey, this is Rose McGowan I think she’s amazing and really talented and I’m going to cast her in my next movie.” Harvey then dribbled all over himself in the most over the top performance I’d ever seen as he gushed, “Oh she’s wonderful, oh she’s amazing, oh she’s fantastic, oh she’s so talented… You two should definitely work together.” And then he skittered off I knew right then that every word Rose told me was true, you could see it all over his face      I looked over at Rose Her mouth was open, and her eyes were wide “WOW I’ve never seen that before,” she said I then told her that if she wanted a role that I would write it for her and Harvey’s company would have to fund it Rose agreed, and the deal was done I found it so commendable that she was putting the incident behind her and moving forward with her career I wanted to help We had a plan, and more importantly, we had a mission      Since the Weinstein’s had a first look at any project of mine or Quentin’s, I knew they’d never let this project go to another studio Casting Rose in a leading role in my next movie felt like the right move to make at the time – to literally make him pay      But because of the NDA Rose told me she had signed, at Rose’s request I had to keep it quiet from everyone until now as to why we were even making that film together, especially Harvey We knew that strategically we couldn’t rub it in his face why we were REALLY doing this movie, because then he’d just bury the movie, not sell it well, and everyone would lose To our horror, Harvey buried our movie anyway, and because we did not want to risk getting sued, we never spoke publicly about the matter It would have been much easier on both of us if we could have just revealed why we were doing it      Even after 12 years, I will never forget sitting with Rose at that party and instantly getting inspired to create a bad ass female action heroine who loses her leg and transforms into a superhero that rights wrongs, battles adversity, mows down rapists, and survives an apocalypse to lead the lost and weary into a land of hope; all with a crackling, retro B-movie aesthetic I’ll admit it felt really good at the time to realize we could use our art form to help Rose right a serious wrong in both how he victimized her years earlier, but also what Harvey was doing to a wonderful actress by blacklisting her and keeping her from working with filmmakers that would have wanted to work with her At the time, it was the only thing we could do      With great understatement, I have to say that it was a long hard road to get that movie made And even though “Grindhouse” received great reviews, Rose got terrific notices, and the film is still a fan favorite today… it was heartbreaking to see Harvey simply bury the movie for its release      Until now, I’ve not been able to say anything about it out of respect for the NDA Rose had signed under extreme pressure from Harvey I am still haunted and disillusioned that after all the good intentions, immense pain and struggle Rose and I and so many talented people went through to make the film, that Harvey Weinstein won in the end by burying the movie just because Rose was the lead actress      It’s been really difficult to admit and come to terms that the NDA handcuffs forced us to needlessly jump through hoops that today would have been unnecessary because of Rose’s fearlessness to speak out, despite the consequences I hope that new legislation will result in NDAs to be legally null and void in situations where rape and assault have been committed and where power is so unequally distributed      Looking back over the years, I have wondered if I would have made the same choices, knowing the bleak outcome We all suffered greatly on the film, and the journey ended up costing us all more than we ever bargained for For me personally, it cost me my marriage of 16 years, my family, a large dose of sanity, and for years I have grappled with the sobering idea that maybe I made a grave error in standing up at all, when no one was even asking me to I know that’s not the message I’d ever want to send out, but it’s been hard to justify something that now is clear was a lose/lose situation from the get-go, and that in the end failed and simply caused more damage The reason I’m saying this is because it’s very clear to me now that when someone does what Harvey Weinstein did, the devastation goes far beyond predator and victim      These past few weeks have given me new clarity and hope by seeing the tide finally turn, seeing Harvey finally on the run, and seeing all the brave women who have come forth with their own shocking and distressing stories of abuse Since I’ve seen a distinct lack of stories coming from men who may have tried to do the right thing, I wanted to come forth to say that no matter the consequences, no matter how far you have to stick your neck out, no matter what you have to lose, that we must fight the good fight Everyone has to make a stand and take action      Speaking out is not nearly enough Even catching someone in the act right away and calling them out as soon as possible is still not nearly enough What I’ve learned from my own experience is that we as a society need to do a hell of a lot more about prevention Once someone like Harvey Weinstein strikes, the waves, ripple effects, and the collateral damage that takes place are far-reaching, unstoppable, and unending Once a predator strikes, it’s simply too late We have to stop these actions from happening to begin with through education, harsher consequences, and zero tolerance We must ensure that justice is served and demand cultural change in our country so that this never happens again ", "summary": "– As Harvey Weinstein's alleged house

(Associated Press)      HATTIESBURG, Miss (AP) — One was a decorated Officer of the Year The other was a proud recent graduate of the academy who had wanted to be a policeman since he was a boy      A routine traffic stop led to their shooting deaths Saturday night — the first Hattiesburg police officers to die in the line of duty in more than 30 years — and four people were arrested, including two who were charged with capital murder      The deaths of Officers Benjamin Deen and Liquori Tate stunned this small city in southern Mississippi      On Sunday morning, bloodstains still marked the street where the two were shot, and a steady stream of people visited the site to leave flowers or balloons In the nearby New Hope Baptist Church, worshippers prayed for the fallen officers and their families      This should remind us to thank all law enforcement for their unwavering service to protect and serve, Mississippi Gov Phil Bryant said in a statement May God keep them all in the hollow of his hand      Marvin Banks, 29, and Joanie Calloway, 22, were each charged with two counts of capital murder, said Warren Strain, a spokesman for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety Banks also was charged with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and with grand theft for fleeing in the police cruiser after the shooting, Strain said      He absconded with a Hattiesburg police cruiser He didn't get very far, three or four blocks and then he ditched that vehicle, Strain said      Banks' 26-year-old brother, Curtis Banks, was charged with two counts of accessory after the fact of capital murder      The fourth person, 28-year-old Cornelius Clark, was arrested and charged with obstruction of justice, he added      All four are expected to make their initial court appearances Monday at the Forest County Justice Court, Strain said      A preliminary investigation indicated Deen had pulled over the vehicle on suspicion of speeding and then called for backup, which is when Tate arrived Strain said it was too early to say who shot the officers or how many shots were fired      The U.S flag flew at half-staff outside the Hattiesburg Police Department, and red roses placed on a concrete sign wilted in the afternoon sun      For many in the community, the first death of an officer in three decades while on duty was a shock The pain hit particularly close to home for Erica Sherrill Owens, whose mother, Sgt Jackie Dole Sherrill, was killed in 1984 while trying to serve a warrant on a suspect      When Owens heard that two officers had been killed, she said she hoped it wasn't someone she knew      Then when I heard one of the names, my heart just sank because I went to high school with him, Owens said, who had gone to Sumrall High School with Deen and graduated a year after him in 1999      We were great friends in high school He married his high school sweetheart and he's got two kids and a great family, she said It's just heartbreaking      Local reports identified Deen, 34, as a former Officer of the Year in Hattiesburg      After high school, Owens said she would see Deen around town and recalled the day he graduated from the police academy      He was so proud, you know? she said      Tate, 25, grew up in Starkville, 150 miles north of Hattiesburg Strain said he was a 2014 graduate of the law enforcement academy      He was known to his friends as CoCo, said his stepfather, B Lonnie Ross of Jackson, adding that Tate was 12 when they met and already wanted to be a policeman      He was the most respectful young man you would meet It was a pleasure to meet someone so gentle and nice, Ross said Everybody who met him liked him      Jarvis Thompson, who knew Tate from childhood, said he wanted to be a policeman to make a difference in the black community      He wanted to become an officer because we've seen so much of our peers get killed or end up in jail, said Thompson, 24, of Starkville He was talking all the time about how he wanted to do better and make the place better      Alberta Harris, who heads the Briarfield Neighborhood Association near the shooting site, said she knew both officers, and both of them had a humble spirit They cared about the people that they were serving and protecting      At a news conference, Mayor Johnny DuPree asked the community to pull together      We want to ask everybody to pray for these families We want everybody to pray for police officers not only here but around the United States, DuPree said      A memorial service is planned for the two officers on Monday      Tony Mozingo, a local judge, left red roses near the scene of the shooting      We all just are heartbroken because we know and work with these officers every day, said Mozingo, accompanied by his wife and two daughters      At the nearby New Hope Baptist Church, the congregation prayed both for the slain officers and for their relatives during services Sunday morning — Mother's Day      It's sad It's just a tragedy, going from one mother to another, said Dorothy Thompson, wife of the pastor Every day is a bad day (for violence), but especially on a day like today      It was the second time that two Hattiesburg police officers were killed together      On March 9, 1952, Hattiesburg officers James Everett and M.W Vinson Jr were both gunned down as they chased

This is relayed on page 44 If you've bought the book seeking business wisdom, you can stop reading You're done      In-N-Out Burger      By Stacy Perman      (Collins Business, 345 pages, $24.99)      Ah, but our tale is not, though it unfolds in a way that Ms Perman cannot soon control She wants us to admire the chain and its plucky founder, à la Sam Walton, but the company benefits mostly from blind luck, and her protagonist is a bit of a martinet Fearful of debt, Harry Snyder expands on the pay-as-you-go plan As it happens, such flintiness serves the company well It never overreaches, never over-extends While Ray Kroc (McDonald's) and Carl Karcher (Carl's Jr.) attach franchise-fueled booster rockets to their fast-food businesses, Ma and Pa Snyder take it slow and steady, one or two million in sales at a time The relative scarcity of their burgers only adds to the appeal, and the chain gains a mystique      Cut to 1976 McDonald's boasts 4,000 restaurants; Harry has only 18, but things are going pretty well Then, rather abruptly, he dies Passing over the elder Snyder son, Guy, Esther and the board install 24-year-old, portly, dyslexic Rich Snyder as president The upending of primogeniture created a conflict between the two brothers whose relationship was already exacerbated by personality clashes, Ms Perman writes It had the emotional intensity of the biblical story of Jacob and Esau without, of course, the bloodlust or deceit Um, sure      Rich's reign lasts 74 pages Not much of a tinkerer, he leaves untouched most of his father's less-is-more business practices, except for an unconsummated flirtation with a chicken sandwich Learning of the plan, Guy went ballistic, according to a friend He was not going to go for that at all      Crisis averted, Rich devotes his energy to buffing his conservative bona fides He gives hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party and adds The Best Enterprise is a Free Enterprise 'God Bless America'  to In-N-Out stationery He prints Bible verses on the chain's soda cups and signs off on In-N-Out radio spots that ask listeners to let Jesus into their lives Confronted with the inevitable complaints, Rich snaps: Well, that's too bad This is God's company, not mine Soon he's supping at the White House, eating roast loin of veal with Dan Quayle He marries a woman 14 years his junior, builds a mansion and, then, rather abruptly, dies in a plane crash At the funeral, hamburgers are served      It's now 1993 Enter Guy Snyder Awkward, also portly, and prone to substance abuse, he is not an ideal chief executive for a company now generating $133 million in sales Before long Guy is shooting heroin, sending a company executive into Mexico to smuggle drugs, and getting busted (on Christmas Day) with a briefcase stuffed with pot, Valium, Klonopin, a 9mm Glock, a switchblade and $27,475 in cash Poor Ms Perman does her darnedest to put a sunny spin on things It was due in no small part to the talented and loyal executive team that In-N-Out Burger remained on a stable and successful course No doubt      We're running of out time, so let me speed things up Rather abruptly, Guy dies in 1999 of a drug-related heart attack, precipitating an ugly tussle for control of the burger chain between one of Guy's ex-wives, 79-year-old Esther, and one of those talented and loyal In-N-Out executives Charges fly over the misuse of corporate funds and sweetheart deals Lawsuits get filed At one point, Esther is made a prisoner in her home, with phone calls and visitors screened by her ex-daughter-in-law      Then, rather abruptly, Esther dies in 2006, leaving Guy's 24-year-old daughter to inherit the company (now worth almost half a billion dollars) With only a high-school education and an affinity for joining off-beat Christian sects, Lynsi Martinez lacks sufficient personal maturity, experience, and skill necessary to successfully run In-N-Out, or so testifies an In-N-Out board member No matter, as Ms Perman writes: The dynasty had been preserved      So, what to make of all this? Ms Perman repeatedly tells us that the story of this family-owned, fiercely independent chain is in fact simply the story of America, writ small Alas, she may be right      Mr Tayman is the author of The Colony: The Harrowing True Story of the Exiles of Molokai      Printed in The Wall Street Journal, page A13 ", "summary": "Or click for another intriguing burger-chain story.", "summary_all": "– As far as company owners go, Lynsi Torres has to be among the most intriguing A Bloomberg article attempts to put a finger on the mysterious In-N-Out Burger president who, at age 30, is one of the youngest female billionaires on the planet As Seth Lubove reports, she ended up at the helm of the company, estimated by Bloomberg to be valued at $1.1 billion, by way of birth and more than a few tragic deaths: Her father took control after his 41-year-old brother died in a 1993 plane crash; he died after ODing on prescription drugs six years later Torres' grandmother then grabbed the reins until her death in 2006, which left the company with a single heir: Torres, who gained 50% ownership after turning 30 in 2012; she'll claim the other half upon her 35th birthday And things get more intriguing from there: She's been married three times and has twins, reports Lubove, but no college degree She largely chooses not to give interviews, but her name quietly and occasionally pops up in the press: In September, she was reported to have purchased a $17.4 million 16-bathroom mansion in Bradbury, California; she's also a drag racer who competes in two National Hot Rod Association categories; and a 2009 Wall Street Journal article noted her \"affinity for joining off-beat Christian sects.\" Business Insider has an image of the colorful heiress, and Bloomberg has more, including a rundown of a 2006 lawsuit a former VP filed against Torres, which claimed she was trying to wrest control of In-N-Out from her grandmother Or click for another intriguing burger-chain story."}

drive-thru lane at In-N-Out Burger in Baldwin Park, California      Plane Crash      “In-N-Out Burger is a private company and this valuation of the company is nothing more than speculation based on estimates from people with no knowledge of In-N-Out’s financials, which are and always have been private,” Carl Van Fleet, the company’s vice president of planning and development, said in an e-mailed statement      Torres, who has never appeared on an international wealth ranking and declined to comment for this article, came to control In-N-Out after several family deaths When her grandfather Harry died in 1976, his second son, Rich, took over as company president and expanded the chain to 93 restaurants from 18      Torres’s father, Harry Guy Snyder, became chief executive following Rich’s 1993 death in a plane crash at age 41 The chain expanded to 140 locations under Guy, who inherited his father’s passion for drag racing      Ford Cobra      When he died of a prescription drug overdose at age 49 in 1999, Snyder’s estate included 27 cars and other vehicles, including a 1965 Ford Cobra and a pair of 1960’s-era Dodge Dart muscle cars, according to his will      Torres’s grandmother Esther -- Harry’s widow -- maintained control of the company until her death in 2006 at age 86 When she died, Torres was the sole family heir She now controls the company through a trust that gave her half ownership when she turned 30 last year, and will give her full control when she turns 35 The company has no other owners, according to an Arizona state corporation commission filing      Few in the restaurant industry have met or know much about the hamburger heiress      “I have no clue about her,” said Janet Lowder, a Rancho Palos Verdes, California, restaurant consultant, who said she was one of the few people to extract the company’s internal finances from Esther Snyder in the 1980’s for industry-wide surveys “I was even surprised there was a granddaughter.”      Limited Menu      Technomic’s Goldin said the lack of visibility extends to management      “I’ve been in the industry a long time, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen any of their people at an industry meeting,” he said “They’re very quiet That’s their culture.”      Torres has little formal management training and no college degree The company was structured to carry on after the demise of its founders, according to a 2003 Harvard Business School case study In-N-Out has never franchised to outside operators, the Harvard researchers said, giving up a low-cost revenue stream in exchange for maintaining quality control      In a 2005 article in the Harvard Business Review, Boston- based Bain & Co consultants Mark Gottfredson and Keith Aspinall attributed the company’s estimated 20 percent profit margins at the time to the simplicity of its limited menu Contrast that with competitors such as Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s and Miami-based Burger King Worldwide Inc (BKW), which regularly change their food offerings      Over-sized Tires      “Other chains seem to change positions as often as they change their underwear,” said Bob Sandelman, chief executive officer of San Clemente, California-based food industry researcher Sandelman & Associates      Butchers carve fresh beef chuck delivered daily to the company’s distribution facility in Baldwin Park, where hamburger patties leave for restaurants on 18-wheeled refrigerated trucks outfitted with over-sized tires so the In-N-Out logo can be better seen on the highway The company only expands as far as its trucks can travel in a day, either from the Baldwin Park complex or a newer facility in Dallas, the only two places where the company makes hamburger patties      ‘Calculated Growth’      In-N-Out expanded to Texas in 2011, after building a warehouse and the patty facility There are now 16 units in the state Conrad Lyon, a Los Angeles-based senior restaurants analyst for B Riley Caris, said additional expansion will continue to be gradual      “I would expect slow, calculated growth,” he said in a phone interview “To outsiders the company’s growth out West likely appears sluggish However, it was management carefully leveraging its brand, real estate and distribution As a private company-owned system, In-N-Out has the luxury of calling the shots to replicate its success without succumbing to potentially detrimental outside influences.”      The company’s pace of expansion was one of the issues at stake in an exchange of lawsuits in 2006 between Torres, In-N- Out executives and Richard Boyd, the company’s former vice president of real estate and development Boyd was one of two trustees overseeing the trust that controls the company’s stock on behalf of Torres      Complaints, Allegations      Among other allegations filed in California state court in Los Angeles, Boyd claimed Torres and Mark Taylor -- her brother- in-law from a half-sister -- conspired to remove Esther Snyder from the company to gain control of In-N-Out He filed a separate petition with the probate court seeking to prevent Torres from removing him as a trustee      Torres denied the allegations in both a formal answer to Boyd’s complaint and a 2006 letter to the editor published in the Los Angeles Times, in which she said she only had “minimal involvement” in the company’s business decisions, and didn’t favor rapid expansion      The company in turn filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Boyd, alleging fraud and embezzlement in connection to Boyd’s relationship to one of In-N-Out’s outside construction firms Boyd’s lawyer, Philip Heller of Fagelbaum & Heller LLP in Los Angeles, said all the litigation was dismissed following a confidential settlement Boyd resigned from the company and the trust      “They were all in the end amicably resolved,” Heller said      16 Bathrooms      Since then, Torres has refused most interview requests, even by author Stacy Perman, who wrote a 352-page book about In- N-Out in 2009 Torres asked to set up a meeting with the author after the book’s publication, but it never occurred, Perman wrote in an afterword to the 2010 paperback edition      Torres popped up in real-estate blogs in September, after buying a $17.4 million, 16,600-square-foot mansion in the wealthy enclave of Bradbury, California, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains A Realtor.com listing for the house described it as having seven bedrooms, 16 bathrooms, a pool, a tennis court and other amenities      Torres is one of almost 90 hidden billionaires discovered by Bloomberg News since the debut of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index in March 2012 Among them: Dirce Camargo, the richest woman in Brazil, and Elaine Marshall, the fourth-richest woman in America      Like Camargo and Marshall, Torres maintains a low profile Her most visible presence has been on the drag strip She competes in the National Hot Rod Association’s Super Gas and Top Sportsman Division 7 categories, alternating between a 1970 Plymouth Barracuda and a 1984 Chevrolet Camaro, according to NHRA results Her third husband, Val Torres Jr., is also a race- car driver      ‘Open Question’      She also inherited her Uncle Rich’s interest in religion, funding a non-profit organization called Healing Hearts & Nations that proselytizes in Africa, according to a 2010 Form 990 foundation filing that lists Torres as the chief financial officer Former In-N-Out executive Boyd alleged in his 2006 cross-complaint against the company that Torres attempted to fire him because he was not a “man of God,” and because he didn’t attend prayer meetings at her home She denied Boyd’s claims in the company’s answer      Whether the mother of twins will maintain ownership in the chain after she gains full control in five years is uncertain, said John Gordon, founder of San Diego-based restaurant consultant Pacific Management Consulting Group      “It’s an open question whether she may have different feelings later,” said Gordon “Like most kids, or second or third generations of a very wealthy family, I don’t know that she has restaurant blood in her veins, or if she’s a trust fund baby.”      To contact the reporter on this story: Seth Lubove in Los Angeles at slubove@bloomberg.net      To contact the editor responsible for this story:

     A mother and daughter from Prince William County were among three Americans who perished when an Airbus jet plunged into a frozen ridge in the French Alps this week, officials said Wednesday      Yvonne Selke, a longtime government contractor, and Emily Selke, a recent graduate of Drexel University, died Tuesday along with 148 others on the Germanwings flight from Spain to Germany      Raymond Selke said he was too distraught to discuss the lives of his wife and daughter or why they were aboard the flight, but the family released a brief statement asking for time to heal      “Our entire family is deeply saddened by the losses of Yvonne and Emily Selke,” the statement read “Two wonderful, caring, amazing people who meant so much to so many At this difficult time we respectfully ask for privacy and your prayers.”      The mystery of why the plane plunged from its flight path endured Wednesday, even as top leaders from Europe monitored the investigation of the crash and recovery efforts continued near the southern French town of Seyne-les-Alpes      [Officials: Flight recorder recovered but damaged]      France’s president was joined by the leaders of Germany and Spain in an Alpine pasture now used as a base for experts seeking to unravel what led to the crash The three, walking side by side, were briefed on the grim recovery efforts in the snowbound French mountains      Earlier in the day, one of the flight recorders — or black boxes — was recovered in a damaged state amid the wide debris field The Associated Press reported that French investigators cracked open the black box and retrieved some audio from its cockpit voice recorder by Wednesday afternoon, hoping to gain their first insights into the possible causes of the crash      Remi Jouty, director of the French aviation investigative agency, said the audio included sounds and voices He said it was too early to draw any conclusions from the recorder French President François Hollande, meanwhile, said the case for the second black box, the flight data recorder, had been found but not its contents, according to the AP      In the D.C area, family, friends and co-workers of the Selkes reacted with shock and grief to their deaths Yvonne Selke was an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton for nearly 23 years, according to the company She was working on a contract with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency      “Yvonne was a wonderful co-worker and a dedicated employee,” Betty Thompson, an executive vice president, wrote in a statement “We are in contact with her family to provide comfort and support, and are providing support options to her co-workers, as well.”      One former classmate said Yvonne Selke had kept in touch with some friends from the Class of 1975 at Springfield High School and had planned to attend their 40th reunion      Emily Selke graduated with honors from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 2013, according to the school She majored in music

and a lifetime Girl Scout The Drexel University Gamma Sigma Sigma chapter posted a message on Facebook saying Selke served as vice president of the service sorority      Drexel professor Xela Batchelder said Selke became involved in an effort to start a local theater and music festival in Pittsburgh Selke was interested in a career in the music industry, Batchelder said, and took classes on festival and entertainment management      “What I really liked about her is that she knew what she wanted to do,” Batchelder said “She took all these extra opportunities that weren’t required to learn more about festival management She was a good self-starter.”      Batchelder said Selke went on a study-abroad trip to Edinburgh to take part in the city’s popular fringe festival Batchelder said that Yvonne Selke joined her daughter for the Scotland trip and that the pair adored each other      Taylor Miller, 21, said Emily Selke was well known at Woodbridge Senior High, where she graduated summa cum laude in 2010 Miller said Selke was a choir singer with a sweet-sounding voice and a writer whose words flowed off the page Miller said that her creative-writing classmate stunned other students to silence when Selke read her work aloud      “Everybody would just melt with what she wrote,” said Miller, of Keyser, W.Va      Miller said Selke could be wickedly sarcastic with her humor, then wow friends a moment later with her kindness      “She was the most open-minded, nicest person,” Miller said “She didn’t care if you were a jock or an introvert She wanted to get to know you That’s why everyone gravitated to Emily — because she wanted to be around you, and people wanted to be around her.”      Miller said she once visited the Selkes’ Nokesville home and was blown away by the family’s idyllic cul-de-sac      “She had the perfect life,” Miller said “She had a nice house, nice clothes But she was so humble It didn’t matter who you were She was always polite and kind.”

{"article_number": 365, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "It was improbable enough when Ben Affleck won a second Academy Award in 2012, following a career slide that included a string of mediocre movies But few in Hollywood — or in his hometown of Cambridge, for that matter — would have predicted that Ben’s younger brother would also win an Oscar      That’s not because Casey Affleck isn’t talented He earned a nomination for best supporting actor a decade ago, for his role in “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.” It’s just that the younger Affleck never seemed much interested in a high-wattage Hollywood career like his celebrated sibling’s      Yet there he was, clutching the golden statue at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles Sunday, looking dumbfounded after hearing he’d won the best-actor Oscar for “Manchester by the Sea.”      Advertisement      The Afflecks, who grew up going to the movies at Off the Wall Cinema in Central Square, are one of only two pairs of brothers to win Academy Awards in different categories (James Goldman won for adapted screenplay in 1968; the following year, William Goldman won for original screenplay.)

Sign up for more newsletters here      Reached Tuesday in Canada, where he’s directing and acting in an independent movie called “Light of My Life,” Casey Affleck, speaking in a monotone reminiscent of his character in “Manchester by the Sea,” talked about becoming the second member of his family to win an Academy Award      “It seems crazy    It must be nice for Mom,” Affleck said, in his first interview since winning the Oscar “I’m pretty proud of all the things Ben’s done, and I’m incredibly proud of the fact the Academy honored me in this way.”      However, not everyone is happy for Casey, who at 41 is three years younger than his brother In the weeks leading up to Sunday’s ceremony, he was dogged in print and online by claims of sexual harassment stemming from a 2010 lawsuit filed by two women who worked with him on the film “I’m Still Here.” Affleck has denied the allegations, and the suit was ultimately settled out of court, but some observers feel that the Academy’s voters paid too little attention to the controversy      On Twitter, there was an immediate backlash to his win “Casey Affleck is avoiding eye contact with every woman in the room #Oscars,” tweeted the viral news website Clickhole Even fellow Bostonian B.J Novak, a writer and producer of “The Office,” tweeted “Can we check Best Actor again.”      Advertisement      Asked about those sentiments Tuesday, Affleck paused and sighed heavily He said both sides in the case are prohibited from commenting on the matter, and none of the people who are condemning him online know what happened      But, he added, “I believe that any kind of mistreatment of anyone for any reason is unacceptable and abhorrent, and everyone deserves to be treated with respect in the workplace and anywhere else.”      “There’s really nothing I can do about it,” Affleck added wearily “Other than live my life the way I know I live it and to speak to what my own values are and how I try to live by them all the time.”      Brother Ben, who won the best-picture Oscar for “Argo” in 2012 and shared, with Matt Damon, the Academy Award for best original screenplay for “Good Will Hunting” in 1997, was the first to congratulate Affleck Sunday night, wrapping his arms around him      Gerry Speca, who was the Afflecks’ drama teacher for their four years at Cambridge Rindge & Latin, said there always was a seriousness of purpose about the brothers, and Casey very much looked up to Ben, even then But they aren’t one and the same      Advertisement      “I know Ben’s an inspiration for Casey, but Ben was able to embrace the whole idea of being in ‘the business,’ ” said Speca, who’s now retired from teaching and is living in East Falmouth “The thing I admire about Casey is his reluctance to embrace all of that.”      Casey spent much of his early career acting in his brother’s shadow, getting small parts in films featuring Ben, including “Good Will Hunting,” “Chasing Amy,” and “200 Cigarettes.”      In 2007, Ben, who was by then a bankable movie star, directed his first film — the gritty, Dorchester-based drama “Gone Baby Gone” — and he cast his brother in the lead The film wasn’t a huge success financially, but it got good reviews and led to higher-profile roles for Casey      “Manchester by the Sea,” written by Kenneth Lonergan, was supposed to be directed by Matt Damon, with another local, John Krasinski, playing the lead But scheduling conflicts forced Damon out, so Lonergan directed and Casey took over the role of Lee Chandler, a handyman who has to return home after his brother dies      “I’ve offered Casey a lot of parts over the years, but he’s tough,” said Chris Moore, a producer of “Manchester by the Sea” who has known Affleck for 20 years “He has a really high bar for what he wants to do Fortunately, he wanted to do this movie.”      Moore said Affleck has always been discerning about the parts he plays — perhaps too discerning — and the producer doesn’t expect that to change because he has won an Academy Award Casey acknowledged he hasn’t been in a lot of blockbusters, but it’s not because he’s opposed to making successful movies: “I’ve chosen the parts that have interested me and parts that I thought I could do a job with but also were challenging and a little bit scary I wish I had more control over my career, but making movies is something you do with lots of people      “I’ve seen ‘Lord of the Rings’ and ‘The Hobbit’ about 25 times each, so I like all kinds of movies, but I’m drawn, as an actor, to dramas about humans living lives I can relate to.”      “I don’t know what [the Oscar] means going forward I don’t plan on changing anything about what I’ve done up to this point,” he said “Every once in a while a part like ‘Manchester by the Sea’ comes along and you get the chance to do it and you just hope, at that moment, you’re ready.”      Mark Shanahan can be reached at mark.shanahan@globe.com  Follow him on Twitter @MarkAShanahan ", "summary":

BUY ur way out of trouble by settling out of court!” Wu, 34, sarcastically tweeted in January “Just do a good acting job, thats all that matters! bc Art isn’t about humanity, right?”      The outspoken actress added in a subsequent post: I've been counseled not to talk about this for career's sake F my career then, I'm a woman & human first That's what my craft is built on      This isn’t the first time the Academy has been criticized for overlooking harassment allegations against male nominees For example, Mel Gibson — who was caught making anti-Semitic remarks on tape in 2006 and pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery in 2011 for hitting his ex-girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva, among other troubling incidents — is nominated this year for directing 2016’s Hacksaw Ridge      While accepting his Golden Globe back in January, Affleck vaguely acknowledged the drama “Despite how I might think I’m in charge at my house, it’s my kids who give me permission to do this because they have got the strength of character to keep at bay all the noise that sometimes surrounds people who live publicly,” the actor — who shares sons Indiana, 12, and Atticus, 9, with wife Summer Phoenix — said      Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Worse, while rough edges have been intentionally shaved off of Sue Sylvester, the supporting characters have become even more egregiously offensive, but none more so than Jacob Ben-Israel (Josh Sussman), a.k.a “Jew-Fro.”      The handling of the character—here presented as a sweaty, stammering, and compulsively masturbating Jew—borders on the anti-Semitic Is it a case of Kosher panic? Or another symbol of that eternal Glee crutch: the use of stereotype as shorthand for character development? Either way, the butt sweat stains, over-the-top hairstyle (“It’s like a Jewish cloud,” cooed Brittany), self-pleasuring during the pep rally performance, and his attempt to actually buy Rachel from Finn are in shockingly poor taste, considering the series’ self-professed messages about acceptance and equality      Instead of illustrating the unspoken and inner desires or fears of the characters, the songs here seem like coldly calculated viral videos, designed to rapidly spread across the Internet      • Watch the Six Best Moments from the Britney Glee Episode            • Itay Hod: Glee’s New Villain(It’s also another indication of the often-contradictory nature of the series itself, one that vacillates between the cheesy and the caustic, sometimes in the same scene.)

Well, this is what they told us:            Project ORCA is a massive undertaking – the Republican Party’s newest, unprecedented and most technologically advanced plan to win the 2012 presidential election      Pretty much everything in that sentence is false The massive undertaking is true, however It would take a lot of planning, training and coordination to be done successfully (oh, we'll get to that in a second) This wasn't really the GOP's effort, it was Team Romney's And perhaps unprecedented would fit if we're discussing failure      The entire purpose of this project was to digitize the decades-old practice of strike lists The old way was to sit with your paper and mark off people that have voted and every hour or so, someone from the campaign would come get your list and take it back to local headquarters Then, they'd begin contacting people that hadn't voted yet and encourage them to head to the polls It's worked for years      From the very start there were warning signs After signing up, you were invited to take part in nightly conference calls The calls were more of the slick marketing speech type than helpful training sessions There was a lot of rah-rahs and lofty talk about how this would change the ballgame      Working primarily as a web developer, I had some serious questions Things like Has this been stress tested?, Is there redundancy in place? and What steps have been taken to combat a coordinated DDOS attack or the like?, among others These types of questions were brushed aside (truth be told, they never took one of my questions) They assured us that the system had been relentlessly tested and would be a tremendous success      On one of the last conference calls (I believe it was on Saturday night), they told us that our packets would be arriving shortly Now, there seemed to be a fair amount of confusion about what they meant by packet Some people on Twitter were wondering if that meant a packet in the mail or a pdf or what Finally, my packet arrived at 4PM on Monday afternoon as an emailed 60 page pdf Nothing came in the mail Because I was out most of the day, I only got around to seeing it at around 10PM Monday night So, I sat down and cursed as I would have to print out 60+ pages of instructions and voter rolls on my home printer Naturally, for reasons I can't begin to comprehend, my printer would not print in black and white with an empty magenta cartridge (No HP, I will never buy another one of your products ever again) So, at this point I became panicked I was expected to be at the polls at 6:45AM and nothing was open I was thankfully able to find a Kinko's open until 11PM that was able to print it out and bind it for me, but this is not something I should have had to do They expected 75-80 year old veteran volunteers to print out 60+ pages on their home computers? The night before election day? From what I hear, other people had similar experiences In fact, many volunteers never received their packets at all      At 6:30AM on Tuesday, I went to the polls I was immediately turned away because I didn't have my poll watcher certificate Many, many people had this problem The impression I got was this was taken care of because they had registered me Others were as well But apparently, I was supposed to go on my own to a Victory Center to pick it up, but that was never communicated properly Outside of the technical problems, this was the single biggest failure of the operation They simply didn't inform people that this was a requirement In fact, check out my checklist from my ORCA packet:            Notice anything missing? My guess is the second Chair (if allowed) was supposed to be poll watcher certificate but they put chair twice This was an instruction packet that went out to 30,000+ people Did no one proof-read it?      So, I headed back home to see if I could get my certificate I called their official help line It went unanswered I tried their legal line Same thing I emailed them No response I continued to do this for six straight hours and never got a response I even tried to call three local victory centers All went straight to voicemail      While I was home, I took to Twitter and the web to try to find some answers From what I saw, these problems were widespread People had been kicked from poll watching for having no certificate Others never received their pdf packets Some were sent the wrong packets from a different area Some received their packet, but their usernames and passwords didn't work      Now a note about the technology itself For starters, this was billed as an app when it was actually a mobile-optimized website (or web app) For days I saw people on Twitter saying they couldn't find the app on the Android Market or iTunes and couldn't download it Well, that's because it didn't exist It was a website This created a ton of confusion Not to mention that they didn't even turn it on until 6AM in the morning, so people couldn't properly familiarize themselves with how it worked on their personal phone beforehand      Next, and this part I find mind-boggingly absurd, the web address was located at https://www.whateveritwas.com/orca Notice the s after http This denotes it's a secure connection, something that's used for e-commerce and web-based email So far, so good The problem is that they didn't auto-forward the regular http to https and as a result, many people got a blank page and thought the system was down Setting up forwarding is the simplest thing in the world and only takes seconds, but they failed to do it This is compounded by the fact that mobile browsers default to http when you just start with www (as 95% of the world does)      By 2PM, I had completely given up I finally got ahold of someone at around 1PM and I never heard back From what I understand, the entire system crashed at around 4PM I'm not sure if that's true, but it wouldn't surprise me I decided to wait for my wife to get home from work to vote, which meant going very late (around 6:15PM) Here's the kicker, I never got a call to go out and vote So, who the hell knows if that end of it was working either      So, the end result was that 30,000+ of the most active and fired-up volunteers were wandering around confused and frustrated when they could have been doing anything else to help Like driving people to the polls, phone-banking, walking door-to-door, etc We lost by fairly small margins in Florida, Virginia, Ohio and Colorado If this had worked could it have closed the gap? I sure hope not for my sanity's sake      The bitter irony of this entire endeavor was that a supposedly small government candidate gutted the local structure of GOTV efforts in favor of a centralized, faceless organization in a far off place (in this case, their Boston headquarters) Wrap your head around that      I'm on Twitter at @JohnEkdahl if you have any questions ", "summary": "Crucial information was never communicated, leaving Ekdahl unable to even watch the polls Breitbart.com has a number of similar reports from other volunteers", "summary_all": "– Before election day, the Romney campaign was touting something it called \"Project ORCA,\" an app that was supposed to revolutionize and digitize the GOP's get-out-the vote efforts How did it work out?

Do click the link for the full Ace of Spades account      But it was described as a mega-app for smartphones that would link the more than 30,000 operatives and volunteers involved in get-out-the-vote efforts PBS profiled it a few days before the election The app was created and managed by the Romney campaign and was kept a secret among a close circle in Boston, according to POLITICO sources It was supposed to be incredibly efficient and allow the campaign to streamline, from its War Room at the Garden in Boston, the efforts to maximize turnout of Romney backers      State officials were kept in the dark about exactly how it would work in the lead-up to Election Day, and there was never a dry run that included early voting, said one of the sources      Among other issues, the system was never beta-tested or checked for functionality in the Boston TD Garden, where it would be used, without going live before Election Day, two sources said It went live that morning but was never checked for bugs or efficiencies internally The volunteer at Ace of Spades also cited this issue but as one by which field workers couldn't get to know the system ahead of Election Day But inside Romneyland, officials were experiencing similar problems as votes were being cast      In other words, it was not the field element that was the problem, it was the machine that was supposed to be coordinating everything and churning through data to allow the teams to make precision efforts Instead, as one source said, it was like landing a plane without instruments      Campaign aides insisted to reporters throughout the day that reports across Twitter that ORCA was problem-plagued were wrong      It's been reported the system crashed at 4 p.m., but multiple sources familiar with the war room operation said it had actually been crashing throughout the day Officials mostly got information about votes either from public news sources tracking data, like CNN.com, or by calling the counties for information, the source said Officials insisted the day after the election that they had still believed they were close, and that they had hit their numbers where they needed to, even as Fox News and other outlets called the race      The numbers in the interface never moved, leaving officials in Boston and out in the states flying blind — a phrase used by several people The workers on the ground didn't know what doors to knock on or what efforts to make with which voter targets who had not yet turned out — some efforts were made but they were slow and more cumbersome And the campaign officials also generally didn't know which precincts to send auto-calls into to try to boost turnout — especially in precincts in Ohio, where there is no party affiliation in the general election Instead of targeted information, all they really had to work with was the generic raw vote tallies in various counties      The whole point of this system was we were supposed to be able to identify who in these precincts had not turned out, who were our supporters, said one source of the system, which was built at a substantial cost The idea behind it was to use pre-canned, targeted messages to push the voters who hadn't yet cast a ballot, one of the most basic aspects of Election Day GOTV, which is knowing which supporters have already voted and who still needs to be part of a pull operation      Romney spokespeople didn't respond to an email for comment      *This post has been updated ", "summary": "– Before election day, the Romney campaign was touting something it called \"Project ORCA,\" an app that was supposed to revolutionize and digitize the GOP's get-out-the vote efforts How did it work out?

{"article_number": 1935, "article_idx": 2, "article_text": " As Republicans try to explain their Election Day losses in terms of policy, tactics, and strategy, one factor is emerging as the essential difference between the Obama and Romney campaigns on November 6: the absolute failure of Romney’s get-out-the-vote effort, which underperformed even John McCain’s lackluster 2008 turnout One culprit appears to be “Orca,” the Romney’s massive technology effort, which failed completely      A source within the Romney campaign agreed to share his reflections on Project Orca with Breitbart News:      It’s easy to point fingers after a loss and I wouldn’t normally do it, but consider what happened      Project Orca was supposed to enable poll watchers to record voter names on their smartphones, by listening for names as voters checked in This would give the campaign real-time turnout data, so they could redirect GOTV resources throughout the day where it was most needed They recruited 37,000 swing state volunteers for this I worked on the Colorado team, and we were called by hundreds (or more) volunteers who couldn’t use the app or the backup phone system The usernames and passwords were wrong, but the reset password tool didn’t work, and we couldn’t change phone PINs We were told the problems were limited and asked to project confidence, have people use pencil and paper, and try to submit again later Then at 6PM they admitted they had issued the wrong PINs to every volunteer in Colorado, and reissued new PINs (which also didn’t work) Meanwhile, counties where we had hundreds of volunteers, such as Denver Colorado, showed zero volunteers in the system all day, but we weren’t allowed to add them In one area, the head of the Republican Party plus 10 volunteers were all locked out The system went down for a half hour during peak voting, but for hundreds or more, it never worked all day Many of the poll watchers I spoke with were very discouraged Many members of our phone bank got up and left I do not know if the system was totally broken, or if I just saw the worst of it But I wonder, because they told us all day that most volunteers were submitting just fine, yet admitted at the end that all of Colorado had the wrong PIN’s They also said the system projected every swing state as pink or red Regardless of the specific difficulties, this idea would only help if executed extremely well Otherwise, those 37,000 swing state volunteers should have been working on GOTV… Somebody messaged me privately after my email and told me that North Carolina had the same problems — every pin was wrong and not fixed until 6PM — and was also told it was localized to North Carolina      The problems with Orca appear to have been nationwide, and predated Election Day itself At Ace of Spades, John Ekdahl reported his frustrations as a volunteer in the field:      From the very start there were warning signs After signing up, you were invited to take part in nightly conference calls The calls were more of the slick marketing speech type than helpful training sessions There was a lot of “rah-rahs” and lofty talk about how this would change the ballgame Working primarily as a web developer, I had some serious questions Things like “Has this been stress tested?”, “Is there redundancy in place?” and “What steps have been taken to combat a coordinated DDOS attack or the like?”, among others These types of questions were brushed aside (truth be told, they never took one of my questions) They assured us that the system had been relentlessly tested and would be a tremendous success      Ekdahl describes how volunteers were expected to print their own materials, and were mistakenly not told to bring their poll watching credentials to polling places Attempts to communicate with the Romney campaign to ask for assistance were unsuccessful:      By 2PM, I had completely given up I finally got ahold of someone at around 1PM and I never heard back From what I understand, the entire system crashed at around 4PM I’m not sure if that’s true, but it wouldn’t surprise me I decided to wait for my wife to get home from work to vote, which meant going very late (around 6:15PM) Here’s the kicker, I never got a call to go out and vote So, who the hell knows if that end of it was working either      Likewise, Twitchy recorded widespread real-time complaints and criticisms on Twitter by Project Orca volunteers At one point during Election Day, the system had malfunctioned so badly that desperate volunteers wondered if the program had been hacked      Romney volunteers in Virginia confirmed that the campaign had relied entirely on Project Orca to turn out the vote in key areas such as Roanoke, where Romney and Ryan had made appearances Volunteers who had driven to Virginia from safely-Republican Tennessee were shocked at the disorganization they encountered      While the Romney campaign waited for Orca to function as planned, the Obama campaign had placed signs outside every one of the city’s thirty-three polling places, and was fully staffed with two volunteers outside each polling place, and a strike list volunteer inside, all day long from 6 a.m to 7 p.m The best that the short-handed Tennessee volunteers could manage was 40% coverage of polling places; the local GOP, they said, had relied entirely on the campaign’s centralized Orca system in Boston to turn out the local vote      Ekdahl concludes his account by hoping that the failures of Orca did not cost Romney the election:      We lost by fairly small margins in Florida, Virginia, Ohio and Colorado If this had worked could it have closed the gap? I sure hope not for my sanity’s sake      In fact, Orca diverted scarce resources that would have been better used physically moving voters to polling places By a rough calculation, Romney lost the election by falling 500,000 to 700,000 votes short in key swing states If each of the 37,000 volunteers that had been devoted to Orca had instead brought 20 voters to the polls in those states over the course of the day, Romney would have won the election      Before the election, there was much fear-mongering on the Democratic side about the Republicans’ supposed plans to suppress turnout among Obama voters After the election, GOP strategist Karl Rove accused the Obama campaign of “suppressing the vote” by running a negative campaign against Romney that kept voters at home      The truth is much worse There was, in fact, massive suppression of the Republican vote–by the Romney campaign, through the diversion of nearly 40,000 volunteers to a failing computer program      There was no Plan B; there was only confusion, and silence ", "summary": "", "summary_all": "– Before election day, the Romney campaign was touting something it called \"Project ORCA,\" an app that was supposed to revolutionize and digitize the GOP's get-out-the vote efforts How did it work out?

essay published early Wednesday, Cosby’s youngest daughter Evin defended the entertainer      My father “loves and respects women,” Evin Cosby, 40, wrote in an essay published on the NNPA Newswire “He is not abusive, violent or a rapist Sure, like many celebrities tempted by opportunity, he had his affairs, but that was between him and my mother They have worked through it and moved on, and I am glad they did for them and for our family”      Cosby, 79, is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting former Temple employee Andrea Constand, now 44, at his Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, mansion in January 2004 Cosby has pleaded not guilty and denies similar claims from more than 50 other women He is scheduled to go to trial on the charges on June 5 Jury selection begins in Pittsburgh on May 22      In his interview with the NNPA Newswire, Cosby said he’s blind About two years ago, he awoke two years ago and said to his wife, Camille, “I can’t see,” he told the outlet      Bill Cosby (left) with Andrew Wyatt in court in Norristown, Pennsylvania on April 3 CLEM MURRAY/AFP/Getty      “Doctors later confirmed the worst: that there was nothing that could be done to repair his vision,” the story says      “When he would perform, we’d draw a wide straight yellow line from backstage to the chair on stage and he’d rehearse the walk, hours before the show,” Andrew Wyatt, one of Cosby’s spokespeople, told the NNPA Newswire      Cosby spoke mostly about his passion and support for education in the interview He said he misses performing and that he hopes to resume his career He stopped performing after he was charged in December 2015 with sexually assaulting Constand      “I hope that day will come,” he told the outlet “I have some routines and storytelling that I am working on I think about walking out on stage somewhere in the United States of America and sitting down in a chair and giving the performance that will be the beginning of the next chapter of my career.”      Cosby declined to discuss the current sexual assault case against him but Evin did not shy away from the topic in her essay      Evin Cosby Bryan Bedder/Getty      “The public persecution of my dad, my kids’ grandfather, and the cruelty of the media and those who speak out branding my father a ‘rapist’ without ever knowing the truth and who shame our family and our friends for defending my dad makes all of this so much worse for my family and my children,” she wrote      “Two years ago, and over 10 years later, several women came out,” she wrote Like the woman from 2005, they claimed to have been raped and drugged But, like the one from 2005, their stories didn’t match up Instead of going through the criminal justice system, these stories never got investigated and just got repeated They have been accepted as the truth My dad tried to defend himself His lawyers tried to defend him, but they all got sued      “People were constantly reaching out to me about why doesn’t your dad say something,” she wrote “I kept saying he’s trying, but the media is only interested in the stories of the women Friends of ours tried to help, but the media wouldn’t print what they said or knew.”      Attorneys for Constand and seven other women with defamation lawsuits against Cosby could not immediately be reached for comment      Evin referenced the January 1997 murder of her 28-year-old brother, Ennis      “I thought when my brother Ennis was murdered, that was the worst nightmare of all time,” she wrote “It’s so hurtful to this day I try to block out the day he was killed, but that pain has only worsened in these last years For some reason, my family’s pain has been a trigger for people to seize upon us harder.” ",

{"article_number": 3605, "article_idx": 2, "article_text": " By Stacy M Brown (NNPA Newswire Contributor)      Bill Cosby is blind      It’s been more than two years since the embattled, television and film legend, who was once known as “America’s Dad,” has spoken out publicly During a recent interview with the NNPA Newswire, Cosby revealed that he’s lost his sight      Waking one morning about two years ago, he nervously called out to Camille, his wife      “I can’t see,” he said Doctors later confirmed the worst: that there was nothing that could be done to repair his vision      “When he would perform, we’d draw a wide straight yellow line from backstage to the chair on the stage and he’d rehearse the walk, hours before the show,” said Andrew Wyatt of the Purpose PR firm, a public relations agency in Birmingham, Ala Wyatt has worked with Cosby for years      Wyatt said that his star client has decided that it’s time to talk Together, Wyatt and Cosby said they grew comfortable that the NNPA Newswire would be more interested in “facts over sensationalism.”      Cosby has shunned most media inquiries, since allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced in late 2014; some of those accusations dated back almost fifty years In 2015, According to CNN, Cosby was charged with three counts of felony aggravated assault in a case involving Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee      Earlier this year, CNN reported that Cosby’s, “criminal sexual assault trial will stay in Montgomery County Court in Pennsylvania, but the jurors will come from another Pennsylvania county.”      In February, a federal judge dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed against Cosby by accuser Katherine McKee, according to USA Today      “This marks the third defamation lawsuit against Cosby that was either withdrawn or dismissed recently, prompting some Cosby crowing,” USA Today reported “However, another defamation case against him, filed by six accusers, is still pending in the same federal court in Massachusetts.”      While the beleaguered superstar declined to address any of his legal cases, his youngest daughter, Evin felt compelled to speak out      In a statement, which can be read in its entirety on BlackPressUSA.com, Evin, 40, questioned the veracity of the allegations against her father      “The harsh and hurtful accusations…that supposedly happened 40 or 50 years ago, before I was born, in another lifetime, and that have been carelessly repeated as truth without allowing my dad to defend himself and without requiring proof, has punished not just my dad but every one of us,” Evin said      Devin T Robinson X, an actor and renowned poet who’s been featured on MTV, NBC, CBS and BET, said that Bill Cosby represents the finest example of someone being found guilty in the court of public opinion without ever facing trial      “Punishing people before they’re convicted in court only seems accurate when it serves a media narrative that doesn’t hurt a specific demographic,” Robinson said      Dr E Faye Williams, the president and CEO of the National Congress of Black Women, Inc., agreed      “If the President of the United States can go on working in the White House after he has bragged about doing gross, sexually-explicit and abusive things to women, without their permission, then justice requires that Bill Cosby should not be punished, unless he is convicted of crimes,” said Williams      Perhaps, the closest Cosby came to addressing his ongoing legal battles during the interview was when he opined about the true history of America      “The history about African-Americans is a history of the United States; but the true histories, not the propaganda that is standard in our nation’s history books,” Cosby said “The great writer, James Baldwin, said, ‘If you lie about me, then you lie about yourself.’ The revolution is in the home There is something about someone saying, ‘I didn’t know that,’ that could cause a change in that person’s thinking.”      Cosby said he thinks about his illustrious career that, at least for now, has been placed on hold because of the court cases      Few have achieved the legendary status enjoyed by Cosby      His career has spanned more than six decades and includes a host of best-selling comedy albums and books, gold and platinum records, and five Grammy Awards      With his role in “I-Spy” in the 1960s, Cosby became the first African-American co-star in a dramatic series, breaking TV’s color barrier and winning three Emmy Awards      After starring opposite Academy Award winner Sidney Poitier in the 1970s trilogy, “Uptown Saturday Night,” “Let’s Do It Again,” and “A Piece of the Action,” Cosby’s star soared even higher in the 1980s when he single-handedly revived the family sitcom and, some argue, saved NBC with “The Cosby Show.”      “Darn right,” he said, when asked if he missed performing “I miss it all and I hope that day will come I have some routines and storytelling that I am working on      Cosby continued: “I think about walking out on stage somewhere in the United States of America and sitting down in a chair and giving the performance that will be the beginning of the next chapter of my career.”      Advertisements ", "summary": "He did say that his career is on hold for now due to the scandal, but that he hopes to perform again someday", "summary_all": "– Bill Cosby's daughter insists her father \"loves and respects women\" in an essay published in his defense on NNPA Newsire Wednesday Evin Cosby, the youngest of Cosby's five children, recalls how her father always wanted the family to be close and says she had a wonderful childhood She slams the \"public persecution\" of her father and the media's \"cruelty,\" insisting that the stories of sexual assault Cosby's accusers are telling don't \"match up\" and were never investigated, yet \"they have been accepted as the truth.\" She says supporters who tried to defend Cosby \"were pressured to shut up\" and that the media didn't publish their support, and insists Cosby has been deemed guilty even though his trial for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand has not yet started \"My dad, like anyone in this country, deserves to be treated fairly under the law,\" she writes \"My dad broke barriers and raised the conscious [sic] of America on important topics, especially for the advancement of women.\" She does acknowledge he had affairs, but says he never raped anyone and those affairs are \"between him and my mother,\" who have worked things out and moved on In a separate interview with NNPA Newsire, which NBC News describes as \"a consortium of black-owned newspapers,\" Cosby himself speaks out, though not much about the case specifically He did say that his career is on hold for now due to the scandal, but that he hopes to perform again someday Cosby, 79, also said that he is now completely blind Jury selection in Cosby's trial begins May 22, and the trial is set to start June 5, People reports."}

father as he worked From the time he worked in Las Vegas to the Cosby show in NYC, he always wanted us to be close, to be a part of his whole life, at home and on stage      I felt loved and remembered loving the moments that my parents shared with us by exposing us to all types of people from all walks of life We grew up appreciating my father’s success because we knew the prejudice and racism he endured getting to where he got and how hard he worked for our family      Because I loved my childhood, I couldn’t wait to have a family of my own I have two amazing children who love their grandfather I already work hard as a single mother, with no full-time help, and with a career in fashion design, I am lucky that I have supportive friends that I call family because my children and I need that support      The public persecution of my dad, my kids’ grandfather, and the cruelty of the media and those who speak out branding my father a “rapist” without ever knowing the truth and who shame our family and our friends for defending my dad, makes all of this so much worse for my family and my children      When people are so quick to cast hate, and make accusations of horrific violence against my dad, they are callous in their carelessness about the harm they are causing to others I thought when my brother Ennis was murdered, that was the worst nightmare of all time      It’s so hurtful to this day I try to block out the day he was killed, but that pain has only worsened in these last years For some reason, my family’s pain has been a trigger for people to seize upon us harder      On the same day that Ennis was murdered, a woman came out claiming that my father had a “love child.” She was arrested for extortion She was not my father’s daughter      On the day I gave birth to my son, another women came out, but that case was dismissed too – the district attorney investigated her claims also and didn’t press charges      Two years ago, and over 10 years later, several women came out Like the woman from 2005, they claimed to have been raped and drugged      But, like the one from 2005, their stories didn’t match up      Instead of going through the criminal

help, but the media wouldn’t print what they said or knew      Our friends that spoke up were pressured to shut up No one wanted to print their supportive words      We live in a scandalous country where the more sexualized and provocative the story, the more attention it gets We get all sorts of mixed up messages in our society      We are told that we have fundamental rights to be innocent until proven guilty But, if enough people think you are a bad person, you are branded a bad person and the media just reinforces that      My dad, like anyone in this country, deserves to be treated fairly under the law My dad broke barriers and raised the conscious of America on important topics, especially for the advancement of women      On “The Cosby Show” he only depicted women as smart and accomplished      On “The Cosby Show” and on “A Different World,” he took on then taboo subjects like menstrual cycles and rape, and even did a show on AIDS before anyone else would bring it up      I am his fourth daughter He raised me to go to college, start my own business, and be my own woman He is helping me raise my children and teach them family values I know that my father loves me, loves

I was born, in another lifetime, and that have been carelessly repeated as truth without allowing my dad to defend himself and without requiring proof, has punished not just my dad but every one of us      They have punished the talented people who were still earning money and feeding their families from my dad’s shows and work      I am pleased that finally we are seeing the whole picture and

(Associated Press)      FILE - In this Friday, Nov 29, 2008, file photo, carts full of merchandise ordered online are rolled to the main packing area for shipping at the Overstock.com warehouse, in Salt Lake City Cyber Monday,.. (Associated Press)      Cyber Monday, coined in 2005 by a shopping trade group that noticed online sales spiked on the Monday following Thanksgiving, is the next in a series of days that stores are counting on to jumpstart the holiday shopping season      It's estimated that this year's Cyber Monday will be the biggest online shopping day of the year for the third year in a row: According to research firm comScore, Americans are expected to spend $1.5 billion, up 20 percent from last year on Cyber Monday, as retailers have ramped up their deals to get shoppers to click on their websites      Amazon.com, which is starting its Cyber Monday deals at midnight on Monday, is offering as much as 60 percent off a Panasonic VIERA 55-inch TV that's usually priced higher than $1,000 Sears is offering $430 off a Maytag washer and dryer, each on sale for $399 And Kmart is offering 75 percent off all of its diamond earrings and $60 off a 12-in-1 multigame table on sale for $89.99      Retailers are hoping the deals will appeal to shoppers like Matt Sexton, 39, who for the first time plans to complete all of his holiday shopping online this year on his iPad tablet computer Sexton, who plans to spend up to $4,000 this season, already shopped online on the day after Thanksgiving known as Black Friday and found a laptop from Best Buy for $399, a $200 savings, among other deals      The descriptions and reviews are so much better online so you can compare and price shop and for the most part get free shipping, said Sexton, who lives in Queens, N.Y., and is a manager at a utility company      Sexton also said that it's easier to return an online purchase to a physical store than it had been in previous years That helps with gifts, he said      How well retailers fare on Cyber Monday will offer insight into Americans' evolving shopping habits during the holiday shopping season, a time when stores can make up to 40 percent of their annual revenue With the growth in high speed Internet access and the wide use of smartphones and tablets, people are relying less on their work computers to shop than they did when Shop.org, the digital division of trade group The National Retail Federation, introduced the term Cyber Monday      People years ago didn't have .. connectivity to shop online at their homes So when they went back to work after Thanksgiving they'd shop on the Monday after, said Vicki Cantrell, executive director of Shop.org Now they don't need the work computer to be able to do that      As a result, the period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday has become busy for online shopping as well Indeed, online sales on Thanksgiving Day, traditionally not a popular day for online shopping, rose 32 percent over last year to $633 million, according to comScore And online sales on Black Friday were up 26 percent from the same day last year, to $1.042 billion It was the first time online sales on Black Friday surpassed $1 billion      For the holiday season-to-date, comScore found that $13.7 billion has been spent online, marking a 16 percent increase over last year The research firm predicts that online sales will surpass 10 percent of total retail spending this holiday season The National Retail Federation estimates that overall retail sales in November and December will be up 4.1 percent this year to $586.1 billion      But as other days become popular for online shopping, Cyber Monday may lose some of its cache To be sure, Cyber Monday hasn't always been the biggest online shopping day In fact, up until three years ago, that title was historically earned by the last day shoppers could order items with standard shipping rates and get them delivered before Christmas That day changes every year, but usually falls in late December      Even though Cyber Monday is expected to be the biggest shopping day this year, industry watchers say it could just be a matter of time before other days take that ranking      Of all the benchmark spending days, Thanksgiving is growing at the fastest rate, up 128 percent over the last five years, said Andrew Lipsman, a spokesman with comScore ", "summary": "– Black Friday sales were

It just seems kind of sad,” a former RIM executive said as he took in the developments on Thursday evening “Companies have come back from the grave Apple has done it There’s no reason RIM can’t They just have to show better leadership over the next few months.”      With files from Josh O'Kane and Steven Chase      With reports from Josh O’Kane and Steven Chase ", "summary": "– BlackBerry maker Research In Motion's freefall is continuing The company says it is cutting 5,000 jobs—nearly a third of its workforce—and experts believe it might not survive long enough to release the new smartphone CEO Thorsten Heins says the delay is due to difficulties with new features on the much-hyped phone and the company is in the midst of a \"strategic review.\" \"They had one hope—one—and that was to make BB10 the greatest thing since sliced bread and get it out on time Clearly, they have failed,\" the chief of a Toronto software firm tells the Globe and Mail \"There’s just no way now to pull out of the death spiral,” he says “With stiff competition and a complete lack of marketplace trust, zombie Steve Jobs couldn't fix RIM.\" Where did it all go wrong for the company?

that allegedly occurred in 1998 and 1985      Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations to investigators on the call, one of which has already been recanted He has been accused of sexual misconduct by three other women and has also denied those allegations He will face lawmakers on Thursday morning following testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, who will testify that Kavanaugh assaulted her in the early 1980s      One of the new claims, first reported by NBC News, stems from an anonymous letter sent to Republican Sen Cory Gardner of Colorado The author wrote that in 1998 her daughter occasionally socialized with Kavanaugh, who was dating the daughter's friend while he was an attorney working on independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation into the Clinton White House      The writer states that her daughter was out at a bar in Washington with three other people, including Kavanaugh and her friend When the group left, the author writes that an inebriated Kavanaugh physically assaulted his date, pushing her up against a wall aggressively and sexually The writer said the alleged incident was seen by at least four witnesses including my daughter      Investigators read from the letter during Tuesday's call with Kavanaugh He responded that we're dealing with an anonymous letter about an anonymous person and an anonymous friend It's ridiculous Total twilight zone And no, I've never done anything like that      I think this is this is crazy town, he added It's a smear campaign I've been in the public eye for 24 years, really public at various points Certainly 1998, when I was in the Starr investigation, that was a very public year      Gardner said in a statement Wednesday evening that his Denver office received the letter on Monday, and it contained no names, no address, and no contact info      Taylor Foy, a spokesman for the Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday evening that we have no reason to assign the letter credibility, and even if we did, we'd have no way to investigate the allegation as it was made anonymously and cannot be corroborated      A second claim involving a call made by a man in Rhode Island to the office of his senator, Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, a member of the Judiciary Committee was recanted by the accuser shortly after being publicized      Investigators read from a report from Whitehouse's office, which stated that early on a Sunday morning in August of 1985, a close acquaintance of the constituent was sexually assaulted by two heavily inebriated men she referred to at the time as Brett and Mark      In addition to the claims, Kavanaugh has publicly been accused of sexual misconduct by Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick Ford and Kavanaugh are testifying before the committee on Thursday Kavanaugh has denied all allegations      Unlike the other allegations against Kavanaugh, the alleged incident in 1998 occurred when he was an adult Ford, Ramirez and Swetnick accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct when he was in high school and college      President Trump said on Wednesday that he would be willing to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination if he believed these allegations were true, but called them false ", "summary": "– Brett Kavanaugh firmly denied a fourth and a fifth allegation of sexual misconduct—one of which was later recanted—in a Tuesday conference

Republicans also said they have spoken to a man who believes he had an encounter with Christine Blasey Ford in 1982, not Kavanaugh      A senior Senate Democratic aide said some in the minority are concerned about Republicans now releasing anonymous allegations in an effort to make all allegations look frivolous We’re focusing on the ones that have names attached      The emergence of other misconduct allegations came hours after the Judiciary panel began to investigate sexual misconduct claims against Kavanaugh by a third woman, conducting a new interview with the Supreme Court nominee even as President Donald Trump decries false accusations by her attorney, according to correspondence obtained by POLITICO on Wednesday      The panel held a call with Kavanaugh on Wednesday evening about attorney Michael Avenatti’s client, Julie Swetnick, who has alleged that she witnessed Kavanaugh's involvement in multiple episodes of misconduct Kavanaugh denied the allegations to the committee on Wednesday, a person briefed on the call said      Democrats on the call protested the lack of an FBI investigation, according to a person briefed on the call Under penalty of felony, Kavanaugh denied the claims when Avenatti made them anonymously on Tuesday and ramped up his public disavowal on Wednesday, calling Swetnick's allegation ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone The committee is also asking Avenatti to allow them to interview Swetnick      Kavanaugh's fresh round of denial came as his nomination continues to wobble despite GOP vows to press ahead to a vote within days of Thursday's blockbuster scheduled hearing with his first sexual misconduct accuser, Ford Senate Republicans who are pushing forward with a committee vote on Kavanaugh as soon as Friday questioned the political implications of Avenatti's involvement — the lawyer is best known for representing Trump antagonist Stormy Daniels — but didn't dismiss Swetnick out of hand      “We should listen to Mr Avenatti’s client in terms of having her come to the committee and answer questions in a bipartisan fashion with staff and move on Now, today Today Today, come in right now, today, said Sen Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)      In her affidavit as released by Avenatti, Swetnick alleged that she has witnessed Kavanaugh's involvement in multiple episodes of sexual misconduct, charging that he was present at parties where girls were sexually assaulted, including herself      I don’t know who this is and this never happened, Kavanaugh said in a statement released by the White House Swetnick does not allege that Kavanaugh participated in the alleged assaults, though she does claim to have seen Trump's high court nominee touch young women without their consent      Even as several Republicans said Wednesday that they wanted to study Swetnick's claim before commenting on how it might affect Kavanaugh's nomination, the GOP's No 2 leader indicated it would not alter the party's plans for confirmation — and cast doubt

longer this nomination strings out the more you’re going to get more reckless allegations that have no basis in fact      Sen Susan Collins of Maine also said Thursday's hearing should go ahead as planned      “The hearing should go forward tomorrow because we’ll find out valuable information,” said Collins, an undecided Republican She takes the latest allegation Wednesday “very seriously,” she said      Separately from the inquiry into Swetnick's claim, an attorney representing a former girlfriend of Mark Judge, the Kavanaugh friend whom Ford claims was in the room during her assault by Kavanaugh, told the Judiciary panel that her client would be willing to testify if need be about her comment to the New Yorker concerning Judge's alleged excessive drinking and sexual conduct      The woman's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, wrote that client Elizabeth Rasor believes that it is her duty as a citizen to tell the truth about what happened      While new potential interviewees came forward, both parties rush to build their cases — legally and politically — ahead of the Judiciary Committee's scheduled Thursday hearing about Ford's sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh, which dates back to their high school years Ford is set to tell the committee in her opening statement that I don’t remember as much as I would like to of her alleged assault by Kavanaugh, but the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget      The 51-year-old college professor also is set to add that I greatly appreciated California Sen Dianne Feinstein's August vow to not share her letter detailing her allegation without my consent, according to copy of Ford's prepared remarks for the Judiciary panel's landmark hearing that was obtained by POLITICO      Ford's attorneys also on Wednesday gave the committee the report on the polygraph examination she took in August regarding her allegations A copy of the report, obtained by POLITICO, shows the examiner classifying her answers about the veracity of her account of her assault as not indicative of deception, with a 0.002 percent probability that her answers were deceptive      Her attorneys declined to give the committee copies of her medical records, writing that they contain private, highly sensitive information, but they earlier submitted affidavits to the committee from her husband and three friends who said Ford told them of the incident, in some cases several years ago Ford’s attorney will use the affidavits to support her testimony during Thursday’s session      In his own prepared remarks for Thursday's hearing, Kavanaugh will tell senators that he categorically and unequivocally denies that he sexually assaulted Ford when they were both in high school more than 30 years ago and call other accusations against him smears      As the controversy swirled, Trump himself weighed in on Twitter about Swetnick's third allegation against Kavanaugh, slamming Avenatti as a total low-life.At a later press conference, he said the allegations against Kavanaugh are all false to me I can only say that what they have done to this man is incredible      The White House is not backing down from defending Kavanaugh amid the fresh allegations, according to a source close to Kavanaugh and his team      Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Republicans to suspend the nomination proceedings and for Kavanaugh to withdraw after the new allegations surfaced      And Deborah Ramirez, who alleges that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her while both were students at Yale University, has declined so far to speak to Judiciary Committee staffers abut that incident Ramirez’s attorneys told the committee in a Wednesday letter obtained by POLITICO that she wants an FBI inquiry as a first step but is willing to testify in the Senate      Ramirez’s attorney William Pittard wrote to the committee’s bipartisan leadership that GOP staff “thus far has been refused to even speak with” her counsels and instead “has insisted that Ms Ramirez first ‘provide her evidence’ Respectfully, that demand misunderstands the process.”      Separately, the Judiciary panel on Wednesday released detailed calendars of Kavanaugh’s activity in the spring and summer of 1982, which included references to trips to St Michael’s, Md., times Kavanaugh was “grounded” and when he went to the beach There is no explicit reference to the party described by Ford      The jockeying over testimony and evidence comes as pressure is growing from Trump and party leaders on undecided GOP senators to back Kavanaugh      “I might have pushed it through a lot faster,” Trump said of the Kavanaugh nomination on Wednesday at the United Nations, indicating that he didn’t even think there should have been a hearing to review Ford’s allegations “I know this particular man, Judge Kavanaugh .. He’s a gem He’s an absolute gem.”      Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) attacked Democrats on Wednesday for declaring that Kavanaugh should not enjoy the presumption of innocence and belittled the strength of the allegations before the Senate He said that after the committee hears from Ford and Kavanaugh, “then it will be time to vote.”      McConnell is planning on keeping the Senate in this weekend so he can begin the process of bringing Kavanaugh’s nomination up for a final vote early next week, pending the outcome of a committee vote scheduled for Friday      Senate Democrats blasted the moves by Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and McConnell, accusing the GOP leadership of prejudging Ford’s testimony before she’d even made it      A spokeswoman for Ford's legal team said later Wednesday that the attorneys had learned of the outside prosecutor the GOP hired from news reports and are still awaiting an opportunity to meet with her, but Ford is ready for tomorrow      But first comes Thursday’s critical hearing, which will offer each senator only five minutes each to question Ford, then Kavanaugh Senators will be able to defer to counsel for their questions if they choose Democrats had hoped for more time      John Bresnahan, Eliana Johnson, Nancy Cook and Rachael Bade contributed to this report ", "summary": "And no, I've never done anything like that.\" (He used the same \"twilight zone\" phrase in regards to a third accusation.)

{"article_number": 2850, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " Victims of bullying at school, and bullies themselves, are more likely to experience psychiatric problems in childhood, studies have shown Now researchers have found that elevated risk of psychiatric trouble extends into adulthood, sometimes even a decade after the intimidation has ended      The new study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry on Wednesday, is the most comprehensive effort to date to establish the long-term consequences of childhood bullying, experts said      “It documents the elevated risk across a wide range of mental health outcomes and over a long period of time,” said Catherine Bradshaw, an expert on bullying and a deputy director of the Center for the Prevention of Youth Violence at Johns Hopkins University, which was not involved in the study      “The experience of bullying in childhood can have profound effects on mental health in adulthood, particularly among youths involved in bullying as both a perpetuator and a victim,” she added      The study followed 1,420 subjects from Western North Carolina who were assessed four to six times between the ages of 9 and 16 Researchers asked both the children and their primary caregivers if they had been bullied or had bullied others in the three months before each assessment Participants were divided into four groups: bullies, victims, bullies who also were victims, and children who were not exposed to bullying at all      Participants were assessed again in young adulthood — at 19, 21 and between 24 and 26 — using structured diagnostic interviews      Researchers found that victims of bullying in childhood were 4.3 times more likely to have an anxiety disorder as adults, compared to those with no history of bullying or being bullied      Bullies who were also victims were particularly troubled: they were 14.5 times more likely to develop panic disorder as adults, compared to those who did not experience bullying, and 4.8 times more likely to experience depression Men who were both bullies and victims were 18.5 times more likely to have had suicidal thoughts in adulthood, compared to the participants who had not been bullied or perpetuators Their female counterparts were 26.7 times more likely to have developed agoraphobia, compared to children not exposed to bullying      Bullies who were not victims of bullying were 4.1 times more likely to have antisocial personality disorder as adults than those never exposed to bullying in their youth      The effects persisted even after the researchers accounted for pre-existing psychiatric problems or other factors that might have contributed to psychiatric disorders, like physical or sexual abuse, poverty and family instability      “We were actually able to say being a victim of bullying is having an effect a decade later, above and beyond other psychiatric problems in childhood and other adversities,” said William E Copeland, lead author of the study and an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University Medical Center      Bullying is not a harmless rite of passage, but inflicts lasting psychiatric damage on a par with certain family dysfunctions, Dr Copeland said “The pattern we are seeing is similar to patterns we see when a child is abused or maltreated or treated very harshly within the family setting,” he said      One limitation of the study is that bullying was not analyzed for frequency, and the researchers’ assessment did not distinguish between interpersonal and overt bullying It only addressed bullying at school, not in other settings      Most of what experts know about the effects of bullying comes from observational studies, not studies of children followed over time      Previous research from Finland, based on questionnaires completed on a single occasion or on military registries, used a sample of 2,540 boys to see if being a bully or a victim at 8 predicted a psychiatric disorder 10 to 15 years later The researchers found frequent bully-victims were at particular risk of adverse long-term outcomes, specifically anxiety and antisocial personality disorders

{"article_number": 3415, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " Who’d have guessed it, but the Vietnam War draft could become a political issue again given the pattern of evasive answers by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump      The New York billionaire, who was a genuine student-athlete in his youth, came away with a medical deferment in 1968 owing to bone spurs in both heels, according to his latest explanation But in seeking to downplay that exemption as “minor” and “short-term,” Trump’s campaign raises more questions than it answers as to how he sidestepped military service during the war      Story Continued Below      This is not a new controversy for the wealthy New Yorker But this weekend, Trump made himself more of a target with his attacks on Sen John McCain (R-Ariz.), a Navy veteran who spent years as a POW in Hanoi And much as Trump insists that the decisive factor was his high number in the December 1969 draft lottery, the real question is how he stayed out of the draft for the nearly 18 months before      Like politics itself, timing was everything in that crucial period of 1968 and 1969, when the Army was running out of volunteer replacements and more and more draftees were needed to man infantry units in Vietnam Draftees represented an ever larger percentage of those Americans killed in action in 1968 and 1969, and college graduates born, like Trump, in 1946 or 1947 became a target for draft boards across the country      Having enjoyed four years of student deferments, the name of the game for many was to find a new way to stay out of the war National Guard slots were coveted as a safer alternative to Vietnam Others got married, had children or found jobs, such as teaching, that might keep the draft board at bay      Most important, when the new-styled lottery was announced in 1969, it changed the rules so a young man’s birth year meant less in the order of the draft Everything now rested instead on what day he was born A high number for that day became the “home free” ticket for those 1946-47 babies who had avoided being drafted until then      In this same period, Bill Clinton famously posed as a future ROTC officer candidate at the University of Arkansas, until his high number came in and he was off the hook George W Bush and Dan Quayle opted not to wait and found places in their states’ National Guard      Trump’s medical deferment for bone spurs was just as timely The process may have been perfectly in order, but he continues to act embarrassed by the fact and is murky about the details      Indeed, for many years, Trump — who was born June 14, 1946 — never mentioned his medical deferment, and Saturday’s explanation from his campaign again downplayed its import      “While attending the University of Pennsylvania’s prestigious Wharton School of Finance, Mr Trump received a minor medical deferment for bone spurs on both heels of his feet,” the statement reads “The medical deferment was expected to be short-term and he was therefore entered in the military draft lottery where he received an extremely high number, 356 out of 365      “When the draft occurred, they never got near his number and he was therefore exempt from serving in the military,” the statement continues “Although he was not a fan of the Vietnam War, yet another disaster for our country, had his draft number been selected he would have proudly served and he is tremendously grateful to all those who did.”      In an interview Sunday on ABC News “This Week” Trump stuck to this account, saying the medical deferment was “minor” and insisting that the lottery had been the deciding factor      “I had a minor medical deferment for feet, for a bone spur of the foot, which was minor,” he said “I was fortunate, in a sense, because I was not a believer in the Vietnam War…But I was entered into the draft and I got a very, very high draft number.”      In fact, a summary of Trump’s draft record — from the National Archives and Records Administration in Missouri and first published by the The Smoking Gun website in 2011 — tells a different story      Trump’s medical deferment is listed for October 1968, months after he had left Wharton And despite the campaign’s statement that it was “expected to be short-term,” there is no evidence in the records of it being dropped before the draft lottery in 1969      The dates suggest the deferment stemmed from a Sept 17, 1968, draft physical at the Armed Forces Center in New York described in a 1992 book on the businessman by veteran journalist Wayne Barrett “The baseball-tennis-squash star qualified for a medical deferment,” Barrett writes, but no explanation is given of the cause      Various news accounts in 2011 also stopped short, and the first mention of bone spurs appears to have come from Trump this past weekend      The fact that Trump was called for a physical within months after graduating indicates that there was a very real threat of him being drafted — long before the December 1969 lottery Any deferment was more than “minor” then And one big question is whether Trump actively sought the deferment by bringing a letter from his own doctor to the physical citing the bone spur problem      Young men with access to friendly family physicians had this advantage at the time in dealing with draft physicals Lower-income individuals, with no doctor but health issues bigger than bone spurs, could find themselves approved for military service      POLITICO asked a Trump spokesperson Saturday about such a letter but the only response as of Sunday afternoon was the more general campaign statement      “Many years later, Mr Trump was responsible for the building of the beautiful Vietnam War Memorial in lower Manhattan, for which he contributed a tremendous sum of money,” that statement concludes “He was also responsible for bringing back the New York City Memorial Day parade in 1995, after our military was embarrassed by the previous year’s parade where almost nobody showed up Mr Trump’s parade was one of the largest parades ever held Today, he remains committed to helping and honoring all of our Veterans.” ", "summary": "The campaign describes the 1968 medical deferment, which Trump says was for bone spurs in his heels, as \"minor\" and \"short-term,\" but it appears to have kept him

{"article_number": 1852, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " Looking for news you can trust?      Subscribe to our free newsletters                  On Friday, FBI Director James Comey set off a political blast when he informed congressional leaders that the bureau had stumbled across emails that might be pertinent to its completed inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s handling of emails when she was secretary of state The Clinton campaign and others criticized Comey for intervening in a presidential campaign by breaking with Justice Department tradition and revealing information about an investigation—information that was vague and perhaps ultimately irrelevant—so close to Election Day On Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid upped the ante He sent Comey a fiery letter saying the FBI chief may have broken the law and pointed to a potentially greater controversy: “In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government…The public has a right to know this information.”      Reid’s missive set off a burst of speculation on Twitter and elsewhere What was he referring to regarding the Republican presidential nominee? At the end of August, Reid had written to Comey and demanded an investigation of the “connections between the Russian government and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign,” and in that letter he indirectly referred to Carter Page, an American businessman cited by Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers, who had financial ties to Russia and had recently visited Moscow Last month, Yahoo News reported that US intelligence officials were probing the links between Page and senior Russian officials (Page has called accusations against him “garbage.”) On Monday, NBC News reported that the FBI has mounted a preliminary inquiry into the foreign business ties of Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chief But Reid’s recent note hinted at more than the Page or Manafort affairs And a former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence tells Mother Jones that in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trump—and that the FBI requested more information from him      “This is something of huge significance, way above party politics,” the former intelligence officer says “I think [Trump’s] own party should be aware of this stuff as well.”      Does this mean the FBI is investigating whether Russian intelligence has attempted to develop a secret relationship with Trump or cultivate him as an asset? Was the former intelligence officer and his material deemed credible or not? An FBI spokeswoman says, “Normally, we don’t talk about whether we are investigating anything.” But a senior US government official not involved in this case but familiar with the former spy tells Mother Jones that he has been a credible source with a proven record of providing reliable, sensitive, and important information to the US government      In June, the former Western intelligence officer—who spent almost two decades on Russian intelligence matters and who now works with a US firm that gathers information on Russia for corporate clients—was assigned the task of researching Trump’s dealings in Russia and elsewhere, according to the former spy and his associates in this American firm This was for an opposition research project originally financed by a Republican client critical of the celebrity mogul (Before the former spy was retained, the project’s financing switched to a client allied with Democrats.) “It started off as a fairly general inquiry,” says the former spook, who asks not to be identified But when he dug into Trump, he notes, he came across troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government According to his sources, he says, “there was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.”      This was, the former spy remarks, “an extraordinary situation.” He regularly consults with US government agencies on Russian matters, and near the start of July on his own initiative—without the permission of the US company that hired him—he sent a report he had written for that firm to a contact at the FBI, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates, who asked not to be identified (He declines to identify the FBI contact.) The former spy says he concluded that the information he had collected on Trump was “sufficiently serious” to share with the FBI      Mother Jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer’s conversations with Russian sources, noted, “Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance.” It maintained that Trump “and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals.” It claimed that Russian intelligence had “compromised” Trump during his visits to Moscow and could “blackmail him.” It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on “bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls.”      The former intelligence officer says the response from the FBI was “shock and horror.” The FBI, after receiving the first memo, did not immediately request additional material, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates Yet in August, they say, the FBI asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources The former spy forwarded to the bureau several memos—some of which referred to members of Trump’s inner circle After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI “It’s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,” he says      “This is something of huge significance, way above party politics,” the former intelligence officer comments “I think [Trump’s] own party should be aware of this stuff as well.”      The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment regarding the memos In the past, Trump has declared, “I have nothing to do with Russia.”      The FBI is certainly investigating the hacks attributed to Russia that have hit American political targets, including the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, the chairman of Clinton’s presidential campaign But there have been few public signs of whether that probe extends to examining possible contacts between the Russian government and Trump (In recent weeks, reporters in Washington have pursued anonymous online reports that a computer server related to the Trump Organization engaged in a high level of activity with servers connected to Alfa Bank, the largest private bank in Russia On Monday, a Slate investigation detailed the pattern of unusual server activity but concluded, “We don’t yet know what this [Trump] server was for, but it deserves further explanation.” In an email to Mother Jones, Hope Hicks, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, maintains, “The Trump Organization is not sending or receiving any communications from this email server The Trump Organization has no communication or relationship with this entity or any Russian entity.” )      According to several national security experts, there is widespread concern in the US intelligence community that Russian intelligence, via hacks, is aiming to undermine the presidential election—to embarrass the United States and delegitimize its democratic elections And the hacks appear to have been designed to benefit Trump In August, Democratic members of the House committee on oversight wrote Comey to ask the FBI to investigate “whether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests may have contributed to these [cyber] attacks in order to interfere with the US presidential election.” In September, Sen Dianne Feinstein and Rep Adam Schiff, the senior Democrats on, respectively, the Senate and House intelligence committees, issued a joint statement accusing Russia of underhanded meddling: “Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S election At the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election.” The Obama White House has declared Russia the culprit in the hacking capers, expressed outrage, and promised a “proportional” response      There’s no way to tell whether the FBI has confirmed or debunked any of the allegations contained in the former spy’s memos But a Russian intelligence attempt to co-opt or cultivate a presidential candidate would mark an even more serious operation than the hacking      In the letter Reid sent to Comey on Sunday, he pointed out that months ago he had asked the FBI director to release information on Trump’s possible Russia ties Since then, according to a Reid spokesman, Reid has been briefed several times The spokesman adds, “He is confident that he knows enough to be extremely alarmed.” ", "summary": "They state Trump surrogates and Russian government intermediaries met continuously to exchange information during the campaign and that Trump accepted intelligence on

has reviewed a 35-page compilation of the memos, from which the two-page synopsis was drawn The memos have since been published by Buzzfeed  The memos originated as opposition research, first commissioned by anti-Trump Republicans, and later by Democrats At this point, CNN is not reporting on details of the memos, as it has not independently corroborated the specific allegations But, in preparing this story, CNN has spoken to multiple high ranking intelligence, administration, congressional and law enforcement officials, as well as foreign officials and others in the private sector with direct knowledge of the memos      Some of the memos were circulating as far back as last summer What has changed since then is that US intelligence agencies have now checked out the former British intelligence operative and his vast network throughout Europe and find him and his sources to be credible enough to include some of the information in the presentations to the President and President-elect a few days ago      On the same day that the President-elect was briefed by the intelligence community, the top four Congressional leaders, and chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees -- the so-called Gang of Eight -- were also provided a summary of the memos regarding Mr Trump, according to law enforcement, intelligence and administration sources      The two-page summary was written without the detailed specifics and information about sources and methods included in the memos by the former British intelligence official That said, the synopsis was considered so sensitive it was not included in the classified report about Russian hacking that was more widely distributed, but rather in an annex only shared at the most senior levels of the government: President Obama, the President-elect, and the eight Congressional leaders      CNN has also learned that on December 9, Senator John McCain gave a full copy of the memos -- dated from June through December, 2016 -- to FBI Director James Comey McCain became aware of the memos from a former British diplomat who had been posted in Moscow But the FBI had already been given a set of the memos compiled up to August 2016, when the former MI6 agent presented them to an FBI official in Rome, according to national security officials      The raw memos on which the synopsis is based were prepared by the former MI6 agent, who was posted in Russia in the 1990s and now runs a private intelligence gathering firm His investigations related to Mr Trump were initially funded by groups and donors supporting Republican opponents of Mr Trump during the GOP primaries, multiple sources confirmed to CNN Those sources also said that once Mr Trump became the nominee, further investigation was funded by groups and donors supporting Hillary Clinton      Spokespeople for the FBI and the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment Officials who spoke to CNN declined to do so on

plane he flew aboard and cause it to bank sideways for a brief time      The seal of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (Photo: FBI)      SAN FRANCISCO — U.S authorities are probing whether a computer security expert was actually able to hack into the computer system of a plane he flew aboard and cause it to bank sideways for a brief time      Chris Roberts, a well-known cybersecurity researcher, had previously alerted authorities to what he said were security flaws in several common airliners      He told FBI agents in April that he had hacked into the in-flight entertainment systems on numerous planes and, in one case, made a plane briefly fly sideways by telling one of the engines to go into climb mode      Senior law enforcement officials said Sunday that no evidence gathered thus far suggests that such a capability, as outlined by Roberts, exists The official was not authorized to speak publicly      While we will not comment on specific allegations, there is no credible information to suggest an airplane's flight control system can be accessed or manipulated from its in flight entertainment system Nevertheless, attempting to tamper with the flight control systems of aircraft is illegal and any such attempts will be taken seriously by law enforcement      Roberts did not respond to requests for comment, but did tweet on Saturday that he's been advised to keep quiet on the topic There's a whole five years of stuff that the affidavit incorrectly compressed into 1 paragraph....lots to untangle, he tweeted      Over last 5 years my only interest has been to improve aircraft security...given the current situation I've been advised against saying much — Chris Roberts (@Sidragon1) May 17, 2015      Roberts told Fox News in March that he knew how to take planes out of the sky by hacking into their entertainment systems      The FBI filed an affidavit in a New York court for a warrant to search Roberts computers April 17, first reported by a Canadian news service on Friday      Sometime before Feb 13, Roberts apparently alerted the FBI to potential vulnerabilities he said he had discovered in the in-flight entertainment (IFE) systems used on Boeing 737-800, 737-900, 757-200 and Airbus A-320.​      According to the warrant request, he was interviewed about these issues by FBI agents on Feb 13 and March 5 Roberts told the agency he was furnishing the information because he wanted the vulnerabilities fixed      During those interviews, Roberts told agents that he had exploited the vulnerabilities he had discovered approximately 15 to 20 times between 2011 and 2014      Roberts told the agents that at least once he took control of a flight's thrust management computer and had been able to tell one engine to climb, causing the plan to briefly go into a sideways movement      On April 15, as he was flying from Denver to Chicago, Roberts tweeted a joke about whether he should hack into plane's engine indication and crew alerting system      Roberts then changed aircraft in Chicago for a flight to Syracuse.The plane he had been riding continued on to Philadelphia When it landed in Philadelphia, FBI agents boarded it and found a damaged Seat Electronic Box in the area where Roberts had been sitting      The outer cover was open approximately 1/2 inch and one of the retaining screws was not seated and was exposed, according to the warrant application            During their previous interviews, Roberts had told them that he was able to hack into the entertainment system by accessing the Seat Electronic Box located under certain seats in a plane      When Roberts' flight to Syracuse landed, he was met by FBI Special Agents      Roberts told the agents he had not compromised the airplane network on the flight from Denver to Chicago, according to the warrant request He was open and helpful, showing the agents wiring schematics for multiple airplane models      At that point, the agents confiscated Roberts iPad, MacBook Pro and several external hard and thumb drives The search warrant application was a request to electronically search them It is not know whether the court granted the search request      When Roberts tried to fly back to Denver two days later, United Airlines informed him he was not welcome on its planes He was, however, able to buy a ticket on another airline and continued his journey      Law enforcement authorities and an aircraft manufacturer have cast doubt on whether the breach described by Roberts was possible      According to a statement from Boeing, which makes three of the four jets Roberts said he was able to hack into, IFE systems on commercial airplanes are isolated from flight and navigation systems      While these systems receive position data and have communication links, the design isolates them from the other systems on airplanes performing critical and essential functions, Boeing said in a statement provided by spokesman Doug Adler      In addition, the company noted that its airplanes have more than one navigational system available to pilots Changes to the flight plans loaded into the airplane systems cannot take place without pilot review and approval      Boeing said its planes meet or exceed all applicable regulatory requirements for both physical and cyber security, but that for security security reasons, it does not give

{"article_number": 3293, "article_idx": 2, "article_text": " A security researcher kicked off a United Airlines flight last month after tweeting about security vulnerabilities in its system had previously taken control of an airplane and caused it to briefly fly sideways, according to an application for a search warrant filed by an FBI agent      Chris Roberts, a security researcher with One World Labs, told the FBI agent during an interview in February that he had hacked the in-flight entertainment system, or IFE, on an airplane and overwrote code on the plane's Thrust Management Computer while aboard the flight He was able to issue a climb command and make the plane briefly change course, the document states      He stated that he thereby caused one of the airplane engines to climb resulting in a lateral or sideways movement of the plane during one of these flights, FBI Special Agent Mark Hurley wrote in his warrant application (.pdf) He also stated that he used Vortex software after comprising/exploiting or 'hacking' the airplane's networks He used the software to monitor traffic from the cockpit system      Hurley filed the search warrant application last month after Roberts was removed from a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Syracuse, New York, because he published a facetious tweet suggesting he might hack into the plane's network Upon landing in Syracuse, two FBI agents and two local police officers escorted him from the plane and interrogated him for several hours They also seized two laptop computers and several hard drives and USB sticks Although the agents did not have a warrant when they seized the devices, they told Roberts a warrant was pending      A media outlet in Canada obtained the application for the warrant today and published it online      The information outlined in the warrant application reveals a far more serious situation than Roberts has previously disclosed      Roberts had previously told WIRED that he caused a plane to climb during a simulated test on a virtual environment he and a colleague created, but he insisted then that he had not interfered with the operation of a plane while in flight      He told WIRED that he did access in-flight networks about 15 times during various flights but had not done anything beyond explore the networks and observe data traffic crossing them According to the FBI affidavit, however, when he mentioned this to agents last February he told them that he also had briefly commandeered a plane during one of those flights      He told the FBI that the period in which he accessed the in-flight networks more than a dozen times occurred between 2011 and 2014 The affidavit, however, does not indicate exactly which flight he allegedly caused to turn to fly to the side      He obtained physical access to the networks through the Seat Electronic Box, or SEB These are installed two to a row, on each side of the aisle under passenger seats, on certain planes After removing the cover to the SEB by wiggling and Squeezing the box, Roberts told agents he attached a Cat6 ethernet cable, with a modified connector, to the box and to his laptop and then used default IDs and passwords to gain access to the inflight entertainment system Once on that network, he was able to gain access to other systems on the planes      Reaction in the security community to the new revelations in the affidavit have been harsh Although Roberts hasn't been charged yet with any crime, and there are questions about whether his actions really did cause the plane to list to the side or he simply thought they did, a number of security researchers have expressed shock that he attempted to tamper with a plane during a flight      I find it really hard to believe but if that is the case he deserves going to jail, wrote Jaime Blasco, director of AlienVault Labs in a tweet      Alex Stamos, chief information security officer of Yahoo, wrote in a tweet, You cannot promote the (true) idea that security research benefits humanity while defending research that endangered hundreds of innocents      Roberts, reached by phone after the FBI document was made public, told WIRED that he had already seen it last month but wasn't expecting it to go public today      My biggest concern is obviously with the multiple conversations that I had with the authorities, he said I’m obviously concerned those were held behind closed doors and apparently they’re no longer behind closed doors      Although he wouldn't respond directly to questions about whether he had hacked that previous flight mentioned in the affidavit, he said the paragraph in the FBI document discussing this is out of context      That paragraph that’s in there is one paragraph out of a lot of discussions, so there is context that is obviously missing which obviously I can’t say anything about, he said It would appear from what I’ve seen that the federal guys took one paragraph out of a lot of discussions and a lot of meetings and notes and just chose that one as opposed to plenty of others      History of Researching Planes      Roberts began investigating aviation security about six years ago after he and a research colleague got hold of publicly available flight manuals and wiring diagrams for various planes The documents showed how inflight entertainment systems on some planes were connected to the passenger satellite phone network, which included functions for operating some cabin control systems These systems were in turn connected to the plane avionics systems They built a test lab using demo software obtained from infotainment vendors and others in order to explore what they could to the networks      In 2010, Roberts gave a presentation about hacking planes and cars at the BSides security conference in Las Vegas Another presentation followed two years later He also spoke directly to airplane manufacturers about the problems with their systems We had conversations with two main airplane builders as well as with two of the top providers of infotainment systems and it never went anywhere, he told WIRED last month      Last February, the FBI in Denver, where Roberts is based, requested a meeting They discussed his research for an hour, and returned a couple weeks later for a discussion that lasted several more hours They wanted to know what was possible and what exactly he and his colleague had done Roberts disclosed that he and his colleague had sniffed the data traffic on more than a dozen flights after connecting their laptops to the infotainment networks      We researched further than that, he told WIRED last month We were within the fuel balancing system and the thrust control system We watched the packets and data going across the network to see where it was going      Eventually, Roberts and his research partner determined that it would take a convoluted set of hacks to seriously subvert an avionics system, but they believed it could be done He insisted to WIRED last month, however, that they did not mess around with that except on simulation systems In simulations, for example, Roberts said they were able to turn the engine controls from cruise to climb, which definitely had the desired effect on the system—the plane sped up and the nose of the airplane went up      Today he would not respond to questions about the new allegations from the FBI that he also messed with the systems during a real flight      The Tweet Heard Round the World      Roberts never heard from the FBI again after that February visit His recent troubles began after he sent out a Tweet on April 15 while aboard a United Airlines flight from Denver to Chicago After news broke about a report from the Government Accountability Office revealing that passenger Wi-Fi networks on some Boeing and Airbus planes could allow an attacker to gain access to avionics systems and commandeer a flight, Roberts published a Tweet that said, Find myself on a

He punctuated the tweet with a smiley face      The tweet was meant as a sarcastic joke; a reference to how he had tried for years to get Boeing and Airbus to heed warnings about security issues with their passenger communications systems His tweet about the Engine Indicator Crew Alert System, or EICAS, was a reference to research he'd done years ago on vulnerabilities in inflight infotainment networks, vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to access cabin controls and deploy a plane's oxygen masks      In response to his tweet, someone else tweeted to him ...aaaaaand you're in jail :)      Roberts responded with, There IS a distinct possibility that the course of action laid out above would land me in an orange suite [sic] rather quickly :)      When an employee with United Airlines' Cyber Security Intelligence Department became aware of the tweet, he contacted the FBI and told agents that Roberts would be on a second flight going from Chicago to Syracuse Although the particular plane Roberts was on at the time the agents seized him in New York was not equipped with an inflight entertainment system like the kind he had previously told the FBI he had hacked, the plane he had flown earlier from Denver to Chicago did have the same system      When an FBI agent later examined that Denver-to-Chicago plane after it landed in another city the same day, he found that the SEBs under the seats where Roberts had been sitting showed signs of tampering, according to the affidavit Roberts had been sitting in seat 3A and the SEB under 2A, the seat in front of him, was damaged      The outer cover of the box was open approximately 1/2 inch and one of the retaining screws was not seated and was exposed, FBI Special Agent Hurley wrote in his affidavit      During the interrogation in Syracuse, Roberts told the agents that he had not compromised the network on the United flight from Denver to Chicago He advised them, however, that he was carrying thumb drives containing malware to compromise networks—malware that he told them was nasty Also on his laptop were schematics for the wiring systems of a number of airplane models All of this would be standard, however, for a security researcher who conducts penetration-testing and research for a living      Nonetheless, based on all of the information that agents had gleaned from their previous interview with Roberts in February as well as the Tweets he'd sent out that day and the apparent signs of tampering on the United flight, the FBI believed that Roberts had the ability and the willingness to use the equipment then with him to access or attempt to access the IFE and possibly the flight control systems on any aircraft equipped with an IFE systems, and that it would endanger public safety to allow him to leave the Syracuse airport that evening with that equipment      When asked by WIRED if he ever connected his laptop to the SEB on his flight from Denver to Chicago, Roberts said, Nope I did not That I’m happy to say and I’ll stand from the top of the tallest tower and yell that one      He also questions the FBI's assessment that the boxes showed signs of tampering      Those boxes are underneath the seats How many people shove luggage and all sorts of things under there?, he said I’d be interested if they looked at the boxes under all the other seats and if they looked like they had been tampered How many of them are broken and cracked or have scuff marks? How many of those do the airlines replace because people shove things under there?      Regardless of whether the authorities have a case against him, however, there has already been some fallout from the incident Roberts told WIRED that today investors on the board of directors of One World Labs, a company he helped found, decided to withdraw their investments in the company As a result, One World Labs had to lay off about a dozen employees today, half of its staff      Roberts said there were other factors contributing to the board's decision but his legal situation was probably the final straw      The board has deemed it a risk So that was one factor in many that made their decision, he said Their decision was not to fund the organization any further ", "summary": "– Can a passenger with a laptop really electronically hijack a plane via its in-flight entertainment system?

Washington took in the South China Sea issue.There are certain forces in the West that are instigating a military clash between China and India, from which they can seek strategic benefits at no cost to themselves Washington applied this scheme in the South China Sea disputes, said the Chinese publication.Even as it accused Washington of being partial to New Delhi, it also claimed that Washington

QuickTake Q&A      The dispute is at a three-way junction between Bhutan, China’s Tibet and India’s Sikkim Bhutan accused a Chinese road-building party of crossing into its territory on June 16 India said its troops approached the Chinese party and urged them to desist from changing the status quo      Most observers expect the standoff to be resolved diplomatically, but a sense of rising nationalism in both countries makes it difficult for either side to stand down That risks prolonging the face-off as troops continue to stare at each other of a September BRICS summit in China’s Xiamen      Chinese state-owned media have issued editorials reminding India of China’s victory in a 1962 border war The Communist Party-affiliated Global Times said India will suffer worse losses than in 1962 if it doesn’t stand down and warned New Delhi to get prepared for all possibilities from a potentially grave escalation of tension in the future      On July 24, defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian warned India not to underestimate the country’s armed forces China’s determination to defend its territory was unshakable, he said, adding that it’s easier to shake a mountain than to shake the People’s Liberation Army      ‘Harsh’ Rhetoric      Chinese rhetoric has remained harsh, rather than softening, and Beijing will want to see how India responds to sustained pressure, said Shashank Joshi, a senior research fellow at London’s Royal United Services Institute, or RUSI The Doval visit could lay the groundwork for formal talks but it is unlikely to produce a quick breakthrough, he said      India and China have several contested borders and minor incursions happen from time to time But this stand-off is the most serious in decades The dispute is near a sensitive narrow corridor that connects India to its northeast and involves a third country      This is different from previous times, both in terms of the rhetoric and in terms of what they’ve chosen to do, said Shivshankar Menon, a former Indian national security adviser who was involved in previous border negotiations with China The Chinese signaling has also changed They obviously see a function for the Global Times that makes sure that China’s views get into the headlines abroad      China’s Confidence      China has accused Indian troops of illegally trespassing into Chinese territory and said India must withdraw troops before any formal negotiations      Indian officials have said they want a peaceful resolution Indian Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar told a group of diplomats in New Delhi on July 21 that the two countries were still talking, according to one western diplomat      China’s statements on the dispute reflect its confidence, according to Michael Kugelman, a senior associate for South Asia at the Washington, D.C.-based Woodrow Wilson Center      China on a very fundamental level has the upper hand because of the strength of its armed forces, which are superior to those of India on many levels, Kugelman said India, which is intent on avoiding a conflict, is using great caution in its public messaging to avoid further antagonizing its Chinese rival I imagine New Delhi has been particularly struck by the unusually sharp rhetoric emanating from the Chinese media      China will not be the first to budge in this standoff because China believes its military is stronger and its position on the border is indisputable, said professor Zhang Li of Sichuan University’s Institute of South Asian Studies      The risk will only increase if the stand-off lingers on, Zhang said ", "summary": "The latest: The advantage: Experts say China has the upper hand because of the strength of its armed forces, per Bloomberg Veiled threats:

and second, that differences should not become disputes.The stridency of Chinese rhetoric has been progressively matched by an equally conciliatory tone by India Foreign secretary, S Jaishankar used this in a recent speech in Singapore, and since then an Astana consensus has been regularly rolled out by government functionaries.Coming even as Ajit Doval and Yang Jieche meet in Beijing, it is intended to convey that India is not spoiling for a fight with China It does not imply that India would give up its ground positions, but means that a search for a diplomatic resolution is seriously underway.Vijay Gokhale, India's ambassador to China, has been the pointperson to engage the Chinese government in Beijing, and sources said he has been holding regular meetings with different sections of the government.In the same spirit, the government told Parliament that India is also engaged with the government of the People's Republic of China through diplomatic channels to maintain peace and tranquillity in accordance with various bilateral agreements, memorandum of understanding, protocol and joint statement of 1993, 1996, 2003, 2005, 2012 and 2013 and is committed to finding an amicable resolution acceptable to concerned countries.Explaining the current crisis, Swaraj, answering questions in Parliament, said they had conveyed to the Chinese side that their actions in Doklam area amount to a significant change in status quo which is not in consonance with the bilateral understandings between India and China under the framework of the Special Representatives on the Boundary Question since the Doklam area is directly relevant for determination of the tri-junction point between India, China and Bhutan ", "summary": "Last month, Indian troops confronted Chinese workers trying to extend a road in a contested area known as the Doklam Plateau at the point where China, India, and Indian ally Bhutan meet One published in the Global Times notes India \"will suffer greater losses than in 1962 if it incites military conflicts.\" India's response: While New Delhi is holding strong, the Times of India notes \"the stridency of Chinese rhetoric has been progressively matched by an equally conciliatory tone by India.\" 'Chicken neck': India's problem is that an armed conflict could result in China taking control of a strip of land near the disputed area, which connects India to its northern territories", "summary_all": "– China and India are in the midst of a potentially volatile border dispute centering on just 34 square miles and an unpaved road Last month, Indian troops confronted Chinese workers trying to extend a road in a contested area known as the Doklam Plateau at the point where China, India, and Indian ally Bhutan meet Both Bhutan and China have a claim to the area because of an ambiguous 1890 border agreement China has vowed to avoid talks until Indian forces withdraw, but India isn't backing down, bringing the two countries, both of which have nuclear weapons, \"near the brink of conflict,\" reports the New York Times The latest: The advantage: Experts say China has the upper hand because of the strength of its armed forces, per Bloomberg And it apparently knows it Addressing India, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi says the solution is \"very simple That is, behave yourself and humbly retreat.\" The road ahead: A scholar at the American Foreign Policy Council sees similarities between this border dispute and another that led to war between China and India in 1962 He tells the Times that while a negotiated settlement is most likely, war is possible Veiled threats: Editorials appearing in Chinese state-owned media have stressed China's victory in the 1962 Sino-Indian War One published in the Global Times notes India \"will suffer greater losses than in 1962 if it incites military conflicts.\" India's response: While New Delhi is holding strong, the Times of India notes \"the stridency of Chinese rhetoric has been progressively matched by an equally conciliatory tone by India.\" 'Chicken neck': India's problem is that an armed conflict could result in China taking control of a strip of land near the disputed area, which connects India to its northern territories The Times notes the loss of this land, known as the \"chicken neck,\" would mean \"cutting off 45 million Indians and an area the size of the United Kingdom.\" Suspected US involvement: An editorial in China's Global Times suggests Washington is \"instigating a military clash between China and India, from which they can seek strategic benefits at no cost to themselves,\" per the Times of India A resolution in the works?

reported being unable to send images and video via messaging tool WhatsApp, and the Canada-based internet research group Citizen Lab found that on China’s most popular messaging app, images are vanishing before they can get from sender to recipient It’s also getting harder to use services that allow internet users in China to bypass the Great Firewall—even if you’re just visiting the country for a few days      Much of the latest wave of online censorship appears to be linked to Liu Xiaobo, China’s most famous dissident, who died last week In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years for subversion of state power, after co-writing a manifesto that called for democratic reform in China He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while he was in jail In late June, China announced that Liu, suffering from terminal liver cancer, was granted a medical parole He died July 13      One of the most iconic images of Liu’s final days is a photo of him arm-in-arm with his wife, Liu Xia, in the hospital The photo circulated widely on Twitter, as people mourned his death, but China wants to make sure that its citizens won’t see it:      A July 16 report from Citizen Lab, based out of the University of Toronto, reveals that images of Liu were automatically filtered in private one-on-one chats on Wechat, China’s most widely used chat app with 768 million daily active users In other words, after being sent by one user, it disappeared and never reached the other user It was the first time it found image deletion occurring in chats between just two people on Wechat, Citizen Lab said The group has previously found that censorship on Wechat primarily occurs in group chats, when users attempt to send messages containing certain keywords      This week, reports from major news outlets including the New York Times (paywall) and Bloomberg found that Facebook-acquired WhatsApp has been partially blocked in China, since earlier this week The WhatsApp disruption also appears to be image-centric: Many WhatsApp users in China have reported that they are not able to send photos and videos, and some also unable to send text messages, according to the Times A cryptography researcher told the Times that the Chinese censors are selectively targeting WhatsApp functionalities WhatsApp has a relatively small user base in China, and differentiates itself from major Chinese messaging services by offering end-to-end encryption      It is unclear whether the partial block on Whatsapp will be lifted or turn into a complete block But the pattern of the past is clear: the Chinese government bans popular Western social-media services including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, effectively forcing its citizens to rely entirely on Chinese equivalents—for example, the far more widely used WeChat—which are subject to censorship and are known to hand over user data to the authorities when required to do so      But there’s a broader context too, beyond Liu China is now only a few months from the 19th congress of the Chinese Communist Party—date to be decided—where major leadership appointments will be announced That’s also a likely reason for the recent disruptions of the two chat apps–and a series of other tightened internet controls Last week, Beijing reportedly stepped up its crackdown on VPN services, a key tool Chinese citizens depend on to get access to

time we see image filtering in one-to-one chat, in addition to image filtering in group chats and WeChat moments      Sina Weibo maintains a ban on searches for Liu Xiaobo’s name in English and Chinese (both simplified and traditional) However, since his passing, his given name (Xiaobo) alone is enough to trigger censorship, showing increased censorship on the platform and a recognition that his passing is a particularly sensitive event      Based on an initial analysis of Weibo’s suggested search keywords, we surmise that there continues to be genuine user interest in producing and finding Liu-related content using alternative keywords      Summary      On July 13, 2017, Liu Xiaobo, China’s only Nobel Peace Prize winner and its most famous political prisoner died from complications due to liver cancer He was detained in December 2008 for his participation with “Charter 08”, a manifesto that called for political reform and an end to one-party rule In June 2017, eight years after his imprisonment, he was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer The government of China rejected his request for permission to receive medical attention abroad, for which they were widely criticized      Following his death, news articles reported cases of social media in China blocking references to Liu Xiaobo and his legacy In this report we analyze censorship related to Liu and his death on two of China’s most popular platforms: WeChat and Sina Weibo      On WeChat, we collected keywords that trigger message censorship related to Liu Xiaobo before and after his death Before his death, messages were blocked that contained his name in combination with other words, for example those related to his medical treatment or requests to receive care abroad However, after his death, we found that simply including his name was enough to trigger blocking of messages, in English and both simplified and traditional Chinese In other words, WeChat issued a blanket ban on his name after his death, greatly expanding the scope of censorship      We documented censorship of images related to Liu on WeChat after his death, and for the first time found images blocked in one-to-one chat We also found images blocked in group chat and WeChat Moments (a feature that resembles Facebook’s Timeline where users can share updates, upload images, and short videos or articles with their friends), before and after his death      We analyzed search term blocking on Weibo and confirmed that it maintains a blanket ban on searches for Liu Xiaobo’s name In fact, just his given name of Xiaobo is enough to trigger censorship in English and both Simplified and Traditional Chinese, something that was not true as recently as June 14 according to monitoring by GreatFire An initial analysis of Weibo’s recommended search keywords, suggests that users continue to have an interest in Liu-related content and use alternative keywords as a workaround      Social media platforms in China regularly censor content related to Liu Xiaobo and his legacy including “Charter 08” and being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize as shown in previous research and user reports However, the death of Liu marks a particularly critical moment for the Communist Party of China (CPC) and, as a result, Chinese Internet companies are facing direct or indirect government pressure to apply broad restrictions to content related to Liu In this report, we analyze how WeChat and Weibo adapted and evolved their censorship efforts in response to Liu Xiaobo’s death      Background of Liu Xiaobo      Liu Xiaobo was one of China’s most famous human rights activists and China’s only Nobel Peace Prize winner He participated in the 1989 Tiananmen Square student protests, advocated for democratic reforms in China, and was an author of “Charter 08,” a manifesto signed by Chinese advocates and intellectuals that called for political reforms and an end to one-party rule Liu was jailed in 2009, charged with “inciting subversion of state power” and sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for his role in “Charter 08” On June 26 2017, after spending eight years in prison, it was announced that Liu had been diagnosed with late-stage liver cancer He was subsequently released from Liaoning Jinzhou Prison to a hospital under guard His death was first announced by The Bureau of Justice in Shenyang city in northeastern China where he was being treated for liver cancer He died in the hospital on July 13, 2017      Liu Xiaobo’s death is a politically sensitive event for the CPC The 1989 Tiananmen Square student protests grew out of a public mourning of Hu Yaobang after his death Hu was a popular political figure who advocated for market and political reform, including for greater government transparency Like Hu, Liu was a popular symbol of political reform and freedom, and his death could potentially rally the public to mourn or cause embarrassment to the authorities      To control the narrative around Liu’s illness, the CPC strictly regulated physical access to him It denied his request to receive medical treatment overseas, despite repeated calls from NGOs and governments, including from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who asked Beijing for a “signal of humanity for Liu Xiaobo and his family.” Beijing nevertheless resisted, saying he was already receiving the best possible care in China and citing Liu’s fragile health, disagreeing with the medical opinion of two foreign doctors who visited Liu and who deemed him strong enough to leave the country      Another example of the CPC’s efforts to control the narrative was provided by the German Embassy in a statement on July 10, which suggested that “certain authorities have evidently made audio and video surveillance recordings of the medical visit of Mr Liu Xiaobo by a German doctor These recordings were made against the expressed wishes of the German side….It seems that these recordings are being leaked selectively to certain Chinese state media outlets It seems that security organs are steering the process, not medical experts.”      Analysts have suggested that Beijing feared that if he had left the country, Liu could again speak out against Beijing and gain the world’s attention      WeChat      WeChat (Weixin 微信 in Chinese) is the most popular chat application in China and the fourth largest in the world, with 768 million daily active users It thrives on the huge user base it has amassed in China, but the Chinese market presents unique challenges Internet companies in China are required to follow laws and regulations on content monitoring and censorship Failure to block sensitive content can lead to fines or revocation of operating licenses      WeChat Keyword-Based Censorship      Our previous research shows that that WeChat keyword-based censorship is enabled for users with accounts registered to mainland China phone numbers Censorship for these types of accounts persists even if these users later link the account to a non-Chinese number      The censorship is not transparent: the message containing a sensitive keyword simply do not appear on the receiver’s end and no notice is given to the sender that their message is blocked or why it was blocked Compared to one-to-one chat, we also found that more keyword combinations are blocked on group chat, where messages can reach an audience of up to 500 users      WeChat can censor a message based on whether it contains a blacklisted keyword combination A keyword combination consists of one or more keyword components When a keyword combination consists of only one component (e.g., “劉曉波”), then a message is filtered if it contains that component For a keyword combination that contains more than one component (e.g., “刘晓波” and “习近平”), a message is censored only if every component in the combination appears somewhere in the message, although not necessarily adjacently In this case censorship rules may be implemented more precisely      Methodology      WeChat performs censorship on the server-side, which means that messages pass through a WeChat server that contains rules for implementing censorship If the message includes a keyword combination that has been targeted for blocking, the entire message will not be received Documenting censorship on a system with a server-side implementation requires devising a message of one or more keywords to test, running that message through the app, and recording the results      We conducted tests to document keyword-based filtering on WeChat from July 2016 to July 2017 We extracted keyword combinations from front page articles of Chinese-language international and independent news media websites to use as a testing sample (see Appendix A) In previous work we found that extracting keywords from these news sources was effective for tracking events and themes that are subject to censorship over a defined time period On July 13, following the announcement of Liu Xiaobo’s death, we retested all related keyword combinations we previously found blocked      We used a script to collect URLs to news articles, using RSS where available, and alternatively from articles listed on the site’s front page Article titles and body text were extracted from each link and sent into a WeChat group chat using four test accounts (two registered to mainland Chinese phone numbers and two registered to Canadian phone numbers) If we found text from the article was censored we then reduced the text down to the minimum number of words required to trigger censorship      Results      Keyword-based Censorship Before Liu Xiaobo’s Death      Between July 1 2016 to July 11 2017 we found 30 keyword combinations censored All 30 combinations were found blocked in group chat with 19 of these also blocked on one-to-one chat (See Table 1)      Language Group Chat One-to-one chat Simplified Chinese 30 19 Table 1: Number of

“去世”, Xiaobo + died) and even his name alone, effectively censoring any messages on WeChat that reference him      Testing conducted on July 13 found that Liu Xiaobo in Traditional Chinese characters (“劉曉波”) and English were blocked in group chat and one-to-one chat On July 14, Liu Xiaobo in simplified Chinese characters (“刘” + “晓波”) was found blocked on group chat (see Table 5)      Keyword

group chat      WeChat Image Censorship      Our previous research shows that image censorship occurs in both WeChat’s chat function and WeChat Moments      In September 2016, Chinese authorities issued regulations stating explicitly that messages and comments on social media products like WeChat Moments can be collected and used to investigate legal cases Recent cases of WeChat users arrested for “insulting police” or “threatening to blow up a government building” on WeChat Moments indicates that the feature may be subject to monitoring by the authorities or the company      Following Liu Xiaobo’s death we found that WeChat filters images related to him on both chat functions (i.e., one-to-one chat and group chat), as well as on WeChat Moments This event is the first time we have documented image filtering on WeChat’s one-to-one chat function, showing that the censorship over the Liu Xiaobo event is more extensive than WeChat image censorship we previously documented      Methodology      Between July 12 11:30pm and July 14 11:30am (EDT), we automatically collected images posted to Twitter with the #LiuXiaoBo hashtag in Chinese language tweets We performed the data collection using the Twitter Public Streaming API We used the filter predicate “pic twitter com #LiuXiaobo”, where “pic twitter com” was used to filter for tweets with embedded images (images hosted on the pic.twitter.com domain) and where “#LiuXiaobo” filtered for tweets with that hashtag      Our testing consisted of two phases The first phase only tested images collected through July 13 11:30am (EDT) and occurred during the afternoon of July 13 (EDT) This sample consisted of 50 images from 50 unique URLs      The second test phase consisted of all images collected during the entire collection period and occurred during the afternoon of July 14 In this phase we tested 119 images from 119 unique URLs, including the 50 from the previous sampling period which we retested      Results      Overall, we found 74 images blocked on WeChat Moments, 26 blocked on group chat and 19 blocked on one-to-one chat These are the first tests in which we have found evidence of image censorship on WeChat’s one-to-one chat In previous research testing image filtering related to the 709 Crackdown case, we found images blocked in group chat and WeChat Moments, but not on one-to-one chat      Images blocked on one-to-one chat were also blocked on group chat and WeChat Moments Images blocked in chat functions were always blocked on WeChat Moments (See Figure 2) Twenty-nine images were uniquely blocked on WeChat Moments The greater attention to WeChat Moments and group chat may be due to the semi-public nature of the two features Messages in these functions can reach a larger audience than one-to-one chat, potentially making these features subject to a higher level of scrutiny However, the blocking of images on one-to-one chat shows an effort to restrict content across semi-public and private chat functions, demonstrating the sensitivity of Liu Xiaobo’s death      It is unclear why only a subset of the images blocked on group chat were also blocked on one-to-one chat It would be technically convenient to enforce censorship of the same sets of images in chat functions One possible explanation is that censorship in smaller, more private spaces is most disruptive and noticeable to users as opposed to ones with larger audiences      Figure 2 Diagram showing how many of the 119 images tested on July 14 that were blocked on each of three different WeChat features All images blocked on one-to-one chat were blocked on group chat, and all images blocked on group chat were blocked on WeChat Moments      Similar to keyword-based filtering, censorship of images is only enabled for users with accounts registered to mainland China phone numbers The filtering is also not transparent No notice is given to a user if the picture they sent is blocked Censorship of an image is concealed from the user who posted the censored image Figure 3 shows a user with an international account successfully posting a censored image: the image is visible to users with international accounts, but the post is hidden from users with China accounts      Figure 3 Evidence of image censorship in WeChat Moments A user with an international account (on the left) posts an image of Liu Xiaobo, which is hidden from the Moment’s feed of user with China account (on the right)      Examples of blocked images include photos and cartoons of Liu Xiaobo and empty chairs symbolizing the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Liu, screenshots of censorship related to Liu on Sina Weibo, and news articles reporting Liu’s death The 19 images that were blocked in one-to-one chat are predominantly images and symbols of Liu Xiaobo, and people commemorating him One of the blocked images was a screenshot of conversation between two Chinese people, who used homonyms (“习禁平”, Xi Ban Ping, the character 禁 sounds like “jin” but means “banned”) of Chinese President Xi Jinping to criticize the authorities’ increasing control over the Internet      Figure 4 Evidence of image censorship in WeChat one-to-one chat A user with an international account (on the left) attempts to send an image of a cartoon of an empty chair symbolizing Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo to an account linked to a mainland Chinese phone number The image is not received by the China account user      Figure 5 Evidence of image censorship on WeChat’s group chat A user with an international account attempts to send an image commemorating Liu Xiaobo’s death in a group chat Users with China accounts in the group did not receive the message      The exact mechanism that WeChat uses to determine which images to filter is unclear and in our testing sample we found unexpected results Blocked images included screenshots of official government statements on Liu Xiaobo’s death, which we did not expect to be censored (see Figure 6) We also found images that were not blocked that could be seen as sensitive, such as an image of book covers of “Charter 08” and a Biography of Liu Xiaobo, which are both banned in mainland China (See Figure 7)      Figure 6 Image of books on “Charter 08” and a Biography of Liu Xiaobo, which are both banned in mainland China The image was not blocked on WeChat      Figure 7 Screenshot of the official announcement of Liu Xiaobo’s death issued by The Bureau of Justice in Shenyang city The image was censored on both group chat and WeChat Moments      Weibo      Sina Weibo is a popular social media platform in China that users have historically congregated on during sensitive moments like national catastrophes and the passing of important figures The platform has a more public nature than WeChat; Weibo is similar to Twitter in that posts are by default viewable by all users, even including those who are not on the platform Anecdotes and past research show it is a more restrictive platform for the sharing of content than WeChat      Weibo Search Censorship      Weibo allows users to search the entire platform for relevant posts Past research has found that search results are heavily filtered We confirm through testing done after Liu’s death that there is a blanket block on any search terms containing Liu Xiaobo’s name in English, simplified Chinese, and traditional Chinese This search blocking does not seem to be a reaction to Liu Xiaobo’s recent illness or death as his name has been fairly consistently blocked on Weibo search in recent years      However, since his passing, even searches that only contain his given name (Xiaobo, 晓波, or 曉波) are blocked According to testing by GreatFire, his given name was accessible as recently as June 14 Like WeChat, Weibo has intensified censorship, recognizing that Liu’s passing is a particularly sensitive event      Weibo’s more restrictive baseline as compared to WeChat may allow for a more seamless user experience during moments of particular sensitivity Users may not be upset if they cannot find content related to sensitive events if they have been normalized to a certain level of censorship on a platform And yet, despite years of becoming accustomed to censorship, we still see examples of Weibo users similarly complaining (see Figure 8) about how their posts have been censored and how they are being restricted from searching for any content using Liu’s proper name      Figure 8: A Sina Weibo User posts a screenshot with a comment: “This is also forbidden? 😷😷😷” Translation of the text in the screenshot which the user attempted to post before getting a “content is illegal!” error, from top to bottom: 1) I have no enemies 2) Candle 3) Trying this one, Liu Xiaobo (alternative characters) is dead      Using Weibo Suggested Search Keywords to Find Related Content      Although censorship on Weibo has made finding information about Liu using his proper name impossible, we can still assess that there is interest in Liu-related content in a number of ways      A user could use alternative keywords for Liu (such as homophones or coded references) to search for related content For example, media reports indicate that alternative ways to reference Liu include “Wang Xiaobo” and “Teacher Liu” We tested these keywords in Weibo search and found neither was particularly effective at uncovering relevant search results, with any potentially relevant content either buried in search results or hidden altogether      But if one were not already familiar with such alternative terms being used by others, it would be near impossible to find relevant information To get around this restriction, a naive user could potentially use Weibo’s own suggested keywords to find relevant, uncensored content      Figure 9: Left: A search for “liuxiaob” recommends search terms like “刘小bo” Right: A search for “liver cancer” returns “liver cancer Liu” as a suggested keyword      With Liu’s passing, we experimented with whether this method might produce relevant results We took nine Liu Xiaobo related keywords (code for the keyword extraction and testing; Google Sheet of results) and ran them through the suggested keywords API returning 201 keywords Not all of these keywords were relevant to Liu but others were and included sensitive topics (e.g., references to Liu and liver cancer, and homophones of Liu’s name)      None of the suggested keywords in our testing sample were censored The specific algorithm that drives how these keywords are suggested is unclear, but a preliminary results shows a number of interesting traits      For many keywords, an autocomplete feature will recommend queries based on partially-entered searches This search feature is common on search engines such as Google For example, searching for 肝癌 (liver cancer) returns auto-suggestions like 肝癌 去世 (liver cancer, pass away) and 肝癌 刘 (liver cancer, Liu) However, when users enter terms in pinyin, the suggested keywords algorithm converts the search request and returns possible Chinese search terms For example, entering “liux” will return suggestions like “刘xiao” and “刘小博”; “liuxiaob” returns “刘小bo” And in cases when a partially-entered query contains blocked keywords or is too specific, the user does not receive recommendations      These suggestions are sensitive to current events, suggesting they are likely informed by query logs (stored user input) — curating or pre-vetting search suggestions would be very labor-intensive Because the recommendations contain sensitive keywords, this hypothesis seems reasonable In Figure 10, a search for 肝癌 (liver cancer) suggests 肝癌 刘 (liver cancer, Liu) If this is indeed the case, the existence of suggested keywords like this and others like 刘小博 and 刘小 speak to continued attempts by users to search for information about Liu and their experiments in using alternative keywords to find the information they want despite initial censorship      It appears that suggestions are ordered by some integer value which appears to measure the number of searches that have been made using a specific keyword Our initial analysis shows that this number is much higher for searches for Liu Xiaobo-related content than is searches for other keywords related sensitive current events (Guo Wengui, Wang Qishan, etc.)      Figure 10: Relevant posts related to Liu Xiaobo which were found by using the keyword “liver cancer, Liu”      Conclusion      Leaked directives and previous research shows that Chinese social media companies receive greater government pressure around critical or sensitive events Consistent with this previous research, our findings document a significant shift in censorship after Liu Xiaobo’s death While it is not known what specific directives may have been sent down from the government, given the high sensitivity of his death it is likely companies received instructions on how to handle it or may have proactively sought out official guidance Before his death, limited talk about Liu on WeChat was allowed, as long as it did not touch upon certain sensitive topics such as his medical care or “Charter 08” In contrast, after his death, the censorship became more expansive and blunt, to the extent that any mention of him is no longer tolerated Similarly, following his death his given name (Xiaobo) alone is enough to trigger censorship on Weibo signalling increased controls on the platform      What explains this development? It might be because of the authorities’ fear for the potential of collective action, but our findings also suggest that censorship exists to help the authorities’ save face or avoid embarrassment For example, the keyword combination of his wife’s name “Liu Xia” (刘霞) and “house arrest” (软禁) triggers censorship; it is possible that this is done to minimize the potential of collective action, but it is more likely that this is done to make sure the authorities do not appear to be cruel or unjust Another example of a keyword combination that triggers censorship that is likely to prevent the authorities from looking uncaring are those related to Liu’s illness and medical care, such as the keyword combination of “Liu Xiaobo + abroad treatment + difficulties in eating” (刘晓波+进食困难+出国治疗)      If the blanket ban of Liu Xiaobo is a reaction to this particular sensitive moment in time, is it possible that discussion of Liu Xiaobo will open up again after a certain period, or will he remain blocked forever, erased from history? Will the Chinese people know or remember who is Liu Xiaobo? In comparison, there are signs that the Chinese, especially the younger generation, are already slowly forgetting about the 1989 Tiananmen Square student protests Continued monitoring of social media in China is necessary to assess if Liu Xiaobo’s death will act as a momentary spike in censorship or the beginning of a sustained effort to wipe him into a collective amnesia      Acknowledgements      Authors are listed in alphabetical order: Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Jeffrey Knockel, Blake Miller, Jason Q Ng, Lotus Ruan, Lokman Tsui, and Ruohan Xiong Special thanks to Ron Deibert for review and supervision      Resources      WeChat Keyword Data      WeChat Image Data      Weibo Search Testing Code      Weibo Suggested Search Results      Appendix A: WeChat Testing News Sources      List of news sources monitored for WeChat testing ", "summary": "", "summary_all": "– Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo's supporters say that in casting his ashes into the sea, the Chinese government hoped to deprive them of a permanent resting place to hold dear What it did instead was create the world's biggest memorial, say those supporters, who plan to gather next to and even in the ocean Wednesday—the seventh day since Liu's death from multiple organ failure related to cancer at age 61—as part of a staging of memorials around the planet The effort will follow water-minding acts and protests that have already occurred in New York, Boston, Melbourne, London, and Hong Kong \"The whole sea has become a place where we can be close to him,\" a friend tells the Guardian Beijing's idea \"backfired,\" adds another activist \"Now anyone can go to the sea and mourn.\" A report from the Canada-based Citizen Lab picked up by Quartz sees Beijing's hand in something else: It found that when users of Wechat—China's most popular messaging app—attempted to message an image of Liu to another user, the image was scrubbed and never made it to the intended recipient (The dying Nobel Prize winner's last words were for his wife.)"}

We have to [protest] with as much creativity as we can.”            “Liu Xiaobo loved the ocean He loved swimming To our generation – in the 80s – the ocean was a symbol of freedom and openness,” Zhou added “So that is where we can feel a connection with him now.”      Additional reporting by Wang Zhen       ", "summary": "– Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo's supporters say that in casting his ashes into the sea, the Chinese government hoped to deprive them of a permanent resting place to hold dear What it did instead was create the world's biggest memorial, say those supporters, who plan to gather next to and even in the ocean Wednesday—the seventh day since Liu's death from multiple organ failure related to cancer at age 61—as part of a staging of memorials around the planet The effort will follow water-minding acts and protests that have already occurred in New York, Boston, Melbourne, London, and Hong Kong \"The whole sea has become a place where we can be close to him,\" a friend tells the Guardian Beijing's idea \"backfired,\" adds another activist", "summary_all": "– Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo's supporters say that in casting his ashes into the sea, the Chinese government hoped to deprive them of a permanent resting place to hold dear What it did instead was create the world's biggest memorial, say those supporters, who plan to gather next to and even in the ocean Wednesday—the seventh day since Liu's death from multiple organ failure related to cancer at age 61—as part of a staging of memorials around the planet The effort will follow water-minding acts and protests that have already occurred in New York, Boston, Melbourne, London, and Hong Kong \"The whole sea has become a place where we can be close to him,\" a friend tells the Guardian Beijing's idea \"backfired,\" adds another activist \"Now anyone can go to the sea and mourn.\" A report from the Canada-based Citizen Lab picked up by Quartz sees Beijing's hand in something else: It found that when users of Wechat—China's most popular messaging app—attempted to message an image of Liu to another user, the image was scrubbed and never made it to the intended recipient (The dying Nobel Prize winner's last words were for his wife.)"}
{"article_number": 1357, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "from our September 2012 issue      Credit: Kobal Collection      Introduction      Ian Christie rings in the changes in our biggest-ever poll      And the loser is – Citizen Kane After 50 years at the top of the Sight & Sound poll, Orson Welles’s debut film has been convincingly ousted by Alfred Hitchcock’s 45th feature Vertigo – and by a whopping 34 votes, compared with the mere five that separated them a decade ago So what does it mean? Given that Kane actually clocked over three times as many votes this year as it did last time, it hasn’t exactly been snubbed by the vastly larger number of voters taking part in this new poll, which has spread its net far wider than any of its six predecessors      But it does mean that Hitchcock, who only entered the top ten in 1982 (two years after his death), has risen steadily in esteem over the course of 30 years, with Vertigo climbing from seventh place, to fourth in 1992, second in 2002 and now first, to make him the Old Master Welles, uniquely, had two films (The Magnificent Ambersons as well as Kane) in the list in 1972 and 1982, but now Ambersons has slipped to 81st place in the top 100      So does 2012 – the first poll to be conducted since the internet became almost certainly the main channel of communication about films – mark a revolution in taste, such as happened in 1962? Back then a brand-new film, Antonioni’s L’avventura, vaulted into second place If there was going to be an equivalent today, it might have been Malick’s The Tree of Life, which only polled one vote less than the last title in the top 100 In fact the highest film from the new century is Wong Kar-wai’s In the Mood for Love, just 12 years old, now sharing joint 24th slot with Dreyer’s venerable Ordet…      Ian Christie’s full essay on changing fashions on our new poll is published in the September 2012 issue of Sight & Sound Texts below are quotations from our poll entries and magazine coverage of the top ten Links are to the BFI’s Explore Film section See Nick James’s poll coverage introduction for details of our methodology, and the ‘further reading’ links at the end of this page      The top 50      Alfred Hitchcock, 1958 (191 votes)      Hitchcock’s supreme and most mysterious piece (as cinema and as an emblem of the art) Paranoia and obsession have never looked better —Marco Müller      After half a century of monopolising the top spot, Citizen Kane was beginning to look smugly inviolable Call it Schadenfreude, but let’s rejoice that this now conventional and ritualised symbol of ‘the greatest’ has finally been taken down a peg The accession of Vertigo is hardly in the nature of a coup d’état Tying for 11th place in 1972, Hitchcock’s masterpiece steadily inched up the poll over the next three decades, and by 2002 was clearly the heir apparent Still, even ardent Wellesians should feel gratified at the modest revolution – if only for the proof that film canons (and the versions of history they legitimate) are not completely fossilised There may be no larger significance in the bare fact that a couple of films made in California 17 years apart have traded numerical rankings on a whimsically impressionistic list Yet the human urge to interpret chance phenomena will not be denied, and Vertigo is a crafty, duplicitous machine for spinning meaning… —Peter Matthews’ opening to his new essay on Vertigo in our September 2012 issue      Orson Welles, 1941 (157 votes)      Kane and Vertigo don’t top the chart by divine right But those two films are just still the best at doing what great cinema ought to do: extending the everyday into the visionary —Nigel Andrews      In the last decade I’ve watched this first feature many times, and each time, it reveals new treasures Clearly, no single film is the greatest ever made But if there were one, for me Kane would now be the strongest contender, bar none —Geoff Andrew      All celluloid life is present in Citizen Kane; seeing it for the first or umpteenth time remains a revelation —Trevor Johnston      Ozu Yasujiro, 1953 (107 votes)      Ozu used to liken himself to a “tofu-maker”, in reference to the way his films – at least the post-war ones – were all variations on a small number of themes So why is it Tokyo Story that is acclaimed by most as his masterpiece? DVD releases have made available such prewar films as I Was Born, But…, and yet the Ozu vote has not been split, and Tokyo Story has actually climbed two places since 2002 It may simply be that in Tokyo Story this most Japanese tofu-maker refined his art to the point of perfection, and crafted a truly universal film about family, time and loss —James Bell      Jean Renoir, 1939 (100 votes)      Only Renoir has managed to express on film the most elevated notion of naturalism, examining this world from a perspective that is dark, cruel but objective, before going on to achieve the serenity of the work of his old age With him, one has no qualms about using superlatives: La Règle du jeu is quite simply the greatest French film by the greatest of French directors —Olivier Père      FW Murnau, 1927 (93 votes)      When F.W Murnau left Germany for America in 1926, did cinema foresee what was coming? Did it sense that change was around the corner – that now was the time to fill up on fantasy, delirium and spectacle before talking actors wrenched the artform closer to reality? Many things make this film more than just a morality tale about temptation and lust, a fable about a young husband so crazy with desire for a city girl that he contemplates drowning his wife, an elemental but sweet story of a husband and wife rediscovering their love for each other Sunrise was an example – perhaps never again repeated on the same scale – of unfettered imagination and the clout of the studio system working together rather than at cross purposes —Isabel Stevens      Stanley Kubrick, 1968 (90 votes)      2001: A Space Odyssey is a stand-along monument, a great visionary leap, unsurpassed in its vision of man and the universe It was a statement that came at a time which now looks something like the peak of humanity’s technological optimism —Roger Ebert      John Ford, 1956 (78 votes)      Do the fluctuations in popularity of John Ford’s intimate revenge epic – no appearance in either critics’ or directors’ top tens in 2002, but fifth in the 1992 critics’ poll – reflect the shifts in popularity of the western? It could be a case of this being a western for people who don’t much care for them, but I suspect it’s more to do with John Ford’s stock having risen higher than ever this past decade and the citing of his influence in the unlikeliest of places in recent cinema —Kieron Corless      Dziga Vertov, 1929 (68 votes)      Is Dziga Vertov’s cine-city symphony a film whose time has finally come? Ranked only no 27 in our last critics’ poll, it now displaces Eisenstein’s erstwhile perennial Battleship Potemkin as the Constructivist Soviet silent of choice Like Eisenstein’s warhorse, it’s an agit-experiment that sees montage as the means to a revolutionary consciousness; but rather than proceeding through fable and illusion, it’s explicitly engaged both with recording the modern urban everyday (which makes it the top documentary in our poll) and with its representation back to its participant-subjects (thus the top meta-movie) —Nick Bradshaw      Carl Dreyer, 1927 (65 votes)      Joan was and remains an unassailable giant of early cinema, a transcendental film comprising tears, fire and madness that relies on extreme close-ups of the human face Over the years it has often been a difficult film to see, but even during its lost years Joan has remained embedded in the critical consciousness, thanks to the strength of its early reception, the striking stills that appeared in film books, its presence in Godard’s Vivre sa vie and recently a series of unforgettable live screenings In 2010 it was designated the most influential film of all time in the Toronto International Film Festival’s ‘Essential 100’ list, where Jonathan Rosenbaum described it as “the pinnacle of silent cinema – and perhaps of the cinema itself.” —Jane Giles                  Federico Fellini, 1963 (64 votes)      Arguably the film that most accurately captures the agonies of creativity and the circus that surrounds filmmaking, equal parts narcissistic, self-deprecating, bitter, nostalgic, warm, critical and funny Dreams, nightmares, reality and memories coexist within the same time-frame; the viewer sees Guido’s world not as it is, but more ‘realistically’ as he experiences it, inserting the film in a lineage that stretches from the Surrealists to David Lynch      —Mar Diestro-Dópido      Sergei Eisenstein, 1925 (63 votes)      Jean Vigo, 1934 (58 votes)      Jean-Luc Godard, 1960 (57 votes)      Francis Ford Coppola, 1979 (53 votes)      Ozu Yasujiro, 1949 (50 votes)      Robert Bresson, 1966 (49 votes)      Kurosawa Akira, 1954 (48 votes)      Ingmar Bergman, 1966 (48 votes)      Andrei Tarkovsky, 1974 (47 votes)      Stanley Donen & Gene Kelly, 1951 (46 votes)      Michelangelo Antonioni, 1960 (43 votes)      Jean-Luc Godard, 1963 (43 votes)      Francis Ford Coppola, 1972 (43 votes)      Carl Dreyer, 1955 (42 votes)      Wong Kar-wai, 2000 (42 votes)      Kurosawa Akira, 1950 (41 votes)      Andrei Tarkovsky, 1966 (41 votes)      David Lynch, 2001 (40 votes)      Andrei Tarkovsky, 1979 (39 votes)      Claude Lanzmann, 1985 (39 votes)      Francis Ford Coppola, 1974 (38 votes)      Martin Scorsese, 1976 (38 votes)      Vittoria De Sica, 1948 (37 votes)      Buster Keaton & Clyde Bruckman, 1926 (35 votes)      Fritz Lang, 1927 (34 votes)      Alfred Hitchcock, 1960 (34 votes)      Chantal Akerman, 1975 (34 votes)      Béla Tarr, 1994 (34 votes)      François Truffaut, 1959 (33 votes)      Federico Fellini, 1960 (33 votes)      Roberto Rossellini, 1954 (32 votes)      Satyajit Ray, 1955 (31 votes)      Billy Wilder, 1959 (31 votes)      Carl Dreyer, 1964 (31 votes)      Jean-Luc Godard, 1965 (31 votes)      Jacques Tati, 1967 (31 votes)      Abbas Kiarostami, 1990 (31 votes)      Gillo Pontecorvo, 1966 (30 votes)      Jean-Luc Godard, 1998 (30 votes)      Charlie Chaplin, 1931 (29 votes)      Mizoguchi Kenji, 1953 (29 votes)      Chris Marker, 1962 (29 votes)      → Explore the complete critics’ and directors’ polls with every individual entry on our special poll site ", "summary": "Sight & Sound, the magazine published by the British Film Institute, says the 1958 movie with Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak got the most votes among 846 international film critics Click here for the full list.", "summary_all": "– Citizen Kane has to take a rare step back: Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo has claimed its long-held title as \"greatest film of all time\" in a well-regarded survey, according to the Hollywood Reporter Sight & Sound, the magazine published by the British Film Institute, says the 1958 movie with Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak got the most votes among 846 international film critics Citizen Kane had been atop the once-a-decade survey since 1962 Tokyo Story, La Règle du jeu, and Sunrise: A Song for Two Humans round out the top five Click here for the full list."}

{"article_number": 4540, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "Comcast Sued By Customer Who Says Cable Company Had Him Fired From Job      Last week, we brought you the story of former Comcast customer Conal O’Rourke, who lost his job at renowned accounting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers after someone from Comcast called his employer with details of Mr O’Rourke’s numerous — and valid — complaints about his cable service Comcast has subsequently apologized for the myriad billing and service problems but maintains it did not intend to have O’Rourke fired, but that has not satisfied Conal, who has filed a lawsuit against the nation’s largest cable company, alleging violations of, among other claims, a federal law prohibiting cable companies from sharing personal information without customers’ consent      The complaint [PDF], filed in a U.S District Court in San Jose, CA, on Thursday, accuses Comcast of violating the Cable Communications Policy Act, defamation, breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and unfair business practices      “Mr O’Rourke’s story is both simple and chilling,” reads the complaint      For those coming late to this story, here’s the brief rundown      In early 2013, Conal became a customer of Comcast From the start, he claims the company failed to provide service at the promised promotional price Multiple promises to resolve the over-billing resulted in only continued inaccurate invoices, even after meeting with Comcast staff in person and presenting them with detailed breakdowns of every charge and credit associated with his account      It eventually got so bad that Conal says Comcast sent and billed him for $1,820 worth of equipment he never requested and did not need      Exasperated with Comcast’s non-responsive customer service, Conal eventually contacted the office of the Comcast Controller, Lawrence Salva, and expressed his opinion that should perhaps be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation      After this discussion with Mr Salva’s office, the controller himself — who had not actually spoken with O’Rourke — contacted Conal’s employer, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which earns a significant amount of revenue (at least $30 million annually, according to the complaint) as a consultant to Comcast      There is little debate about the above points Where Conal and Comcast differ is their respective accounts of his call to Mr Salva’s office      Comcast claims that Conal mentioned that he was employed by PwC and attempted to use it as leverage to get better service      “Mr O’Rourke believes that the Controller’s office performed an online search after Mr O’Rourke stated that Comcast should be investigated by the PCAOB, and learned that Mr O’Rourke worked for PwC,” contends the complaint      The call from Mr Salva — who is also named as a defendant in the suit — to a PwC executive resulted in Conal being subjected to an ethics investigation, which Conal claims consisted solely of a 20-minute phone interview      Conal says he has made repeated requests for recordings of the call where he is purported to have name-dropped PwC, but in spite of Comcast’s claims that it exists, the recording has not materialized Additionally, neither Comcast nor PwC will provide details on exactly what Mr Salva told PwC      “Defendant Salva either directly asked for Mr O’Rourke’s termination, or implicitly requested and caused it by making the knowingly false, defamatory, and malicious accusation that Mr O’Rourke had violated accounting ethics rules by attempting to use his employment with PWC as leverage in his ‘negotiations’ with Comcast,” contends the lawsuit      Section 551(c) of the Cable Communications Policy Act forbids cable companies from disclosing “personally identifiable information concerning any subscriber without the prior written or electronic consent of the subscriber concerned.” And since Comcast has yet to argue in any of its statements that it obtained this permission, Conal believes the company has violated this statute      Additionally, Section 551(f) of the same law allows victims of such violations to seek actual and punitive damages, along with legal costs      The lawsuit also alleges breach of contract, as Comcast has admitted publicly that it failed to live up to its obligation to provide the service that Conal ordered and paid for      “Comcast breached the Agreement when it engaged in… overcharging Mr O’Rourke, failing to show up for service appointments, sending Mr O’Rourke to collections, and failing to repair his internet service,” reads the complaint      Finally, Conal accuses the defendants of engaging in “unfair, unlawful and fraudulent business practices” in violation of California Business & Professions Code, by “violating his privacy, defaming him to his employer, unfairly and persistently overcharging him, and retaliating against him for questioning the legality and propriety of its billing and collections practices.”      The suit ultimately seeks damages and legal costs in excess of $1 million, an injunction barring Comcast from: providing subscribers’ personal information to third parties without consent; defaming customers to third parties; over-billing customers; and retaliating against customers who complain      UPDATE: Comcast has provided the following statement to Consumerist regarding the lawsuit:      “We don’t normally comment on pending litigation and as we have said, there were clear deficiencies in the customer service that we delivered to Mr O’Rourke Comcast had nothing to do with PricewaterhouseCoopers’ decision to terminate Mr O’Rourke Once again, we apologize to Mr O’Rourke for his service issues We said we were determined to get to the bottom of exactly what happened with Mr O’Rourke’s service and we are doing that As part of this investigation, we have listened to recorded calls between Mr O’Rourke and our customer service representatives and his treatment of them and his language is totally unspeakable Mr O’Rourke’s claims are without merit.”      UPDATE #2: Harmeet K Dhillon of Dhillon Law Group, the firm representing Conal, has provided the following response to Comcast’s statement:      “It is unclear whether Comcast is accusing our client of using profanity, or simply being angry after months overcharging and broken promises to resolve his billing problems In any event, being angry or using profanity isn’t illegal Even reciting a George Carlin routine in frustration at utterly incompetent and abusive ‘customer service’ isn’t illegal Violating the privacy of a cable subscriber and defaming him to his employer, is.” ", "summary": "– Conal O'Rourke says

What else could Comcast — which has admitted contacting Conal’s employer, accounting giant PriceWaterhouseCoopers, following his complaint to the office of the Comcast Controller — expect would happen when it contacts an executive at a company that relies on Comcast for a nice chunk of its revenue and says “Hey PwC, one of your guys was really rude to our staffers”?

{"article_number": 4985, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "For decades, there have been studies suggesting that human babies are capable of imitating facial gestures, hand gestures, facial expressions, or vocal sounds right from their first weeks of life after birth But, based on new evidence, researchers reporting in the Cell Press journal Current Biology on May 5, 2016 now say that just isn't so      After testing young infants repeatedly over their first couple of months, they found no evidence at all that very young infants are capable of imitation      Numerous studies from the 1980s and 90s indicated no imitation by newborns, while others claimed it was there, says Virginia Slaughter of the University of Queensland in Australia We wanted to clear up the confusion because the 'fact' that newborns imitate is widely cited, not just in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and pediatrics, but also in popular sources for parents      If the youngest babies can't imitate, then how did so many studies suggest that they could? Slaughter says the main limitation of earlier work is that researchers presented infants with a limited number of gestures For example, she says, in most studies, researchers only tested infants' responses to an adult poking out her tongue and opening her mouth      To do that, they measured infants' levels of tongue protrusion and mouth opening before the adult did anything and then assessed changes in the infants' behaviors after the adult showed one of those two gestures In many cases, the babies did poke their tongues out more after they saw an adult's tongue poking compared to mouth opening However, the researchers didn't have adults make any additional gestures or expressions, to see whether infants were truly imitating the adult's behavior      If infants also increase their tongue protrusions when an adult models a happy face or finger pointing, then it's not a case of imitation, but probably excitement at seeing an adult do something interesting, Slaughter says We eliminated this problem by assessing infants' responses to a wide range of different models      In the new study, Slaughter and her colleagues presented 106 infants with nine social and two non-social models and scored their responses at 1, 2, 6, and 9 weeks of age The results were quite clear: the infants did not imitate any of the behaviors that they observed In response to the grownups they saw, they were just as likely to produce a different gesture as they were to produce a matching one      Slaughter says that this result is not what they'd anticipated In fact, they set out initially with the goal to examine whether differences in imitation amongst young infants would predict later imitation and other aspects of social development      The findings now suggest that imitation isn't an innate behavior, but one that is learned in babies' first months In fact, babies might learn to imitate other people based on watching other people imitate them      Infants aren't born with the ability to copy what other people do, but they acquire that skill during the first months of life, Slaughter says One possibility is that being imitated plays a role in this acquisition In another study from our lab, we found that parents imitate their babies once every two minutes on average; this is a powerful means by which infants can learn to link their gestures with those of another person      The findings should come as encouraging news for anyone who has noticed that their newborns don't imitate them That's perfectly normal, and they almost certainly will over time      The researchers are now analyzing additional data from their longitudinal study, extending into the second year of life They say they want to know when infants really do begin to imitate and what factors may contribute to the emergence of this skill      ###      This research was supported by the Australian Research Council      Current Biology, Oostenbroek et al: Comprehensive Longitudinal Study Challenges the Existence of Neonatal Imitation in Humans http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(16)30257-3 ", "summary": "\"We wanted to clear up the confusion because the 'fact' that newborns imitate is widely cited .. in popular sources for parents,\" researcher Virginia Slaughter says in a press release She says the problem with earlier studies is that they looked only at a few gestures, mostly just sticking out the tongue and opening the mouth \"If infants also increase their tongue protrusions when an adult models a happy face or finger pointing, then it's not a case of imitation, but probably excitement at seeing an adult do something interesting,\" Slaughter says \"We eliminated this problem by assessing infants' responses to a wide range of different models.\" The new study, published Thursday, tested 11 gestures on 106 infants between 1 and 9 weeks old What researchers call the \"most comprehensive longitudinal study\" of imitation in infants found no, well, imitation in infants On the other hand, researchers found that parents imitate their baby every two minutes or so", "summary_all": "– Contradicting parenting websites and books—and probably a bunch of overly proud new parents—researchers have concluded that infants in the first weeks of life actually don't imitate facial expressions or hand gestures In fact, the study suggests that it's the adults who are imitating the babies, reports Australia's ABC Over the past decades, some studies have suggested that infants imitate people, while others found no proof \"We wanted to clear up the confusion because the 'fact' that newborns imitate is widely cited .. in popular sources for parents,\" researcher Virginia Slaughter says in a press release She says the problem with earlier studies is that they looked only at a few gestures, mostly just sticking out the tongue and opening the mouth \"If infants also increase their tongue protrusions when an adult models a happy face or finger pointing, then it's not a case of imitation, but probably excitement at seeing an adult do something interesting,\" Slaughter says \"We eliminated this problem by assessing infants' responses to a wide range of different models.\" The new study, published Thursday, tested 11 gestures on 106 infants between 1 and 9 weeks old What researchers call the \"most comprehensive longitudinal study\" of imitation in infants found no, well, imitation in infants On the other hand, researchers found that parents imitate their baby every two minutes or so (Playing with babies helps them learn to pay attention.)"}
{"article_number": 4985, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " Do newborn babies imitate adults? New study says 'no', rekindling long-standing debate      Posted      Newborn babies do not imitate us — we imitate them — according to a new study that reignites a long-standing debate over whether or not babies are born with the ability to copy adults      Key points Large, comprehensive study suggests babies are not born imitators and need to learn skill      Infants produced gestures independently of what the adult did      Some say study is a game changer, others say it is flawed      Websites and books aimed at new mothers and even textbooks tell us that babies are born imitators, but a new study published today in Current Biology supports the idea that it is a skill they have to learn — likely by us imitating them, rather than the other way around      When we interact with babies .. we want to bring them into our world, said senior author Professor Virginia Slaughter, a developmental psychologist at the University of Queensland      We imitate them, and when we imitate them, this stimulates them to behave      We continue to imitate their behaviour and this sets up a reciprocal interaction that looks like imitation and that ultimately becomes imitation but is driven by the parents or the adult's behaviour rather than the baby copying what somebody does perfectly from birth      Researchers have long been divided over whether newborn babies can imitate adults — and while some studies have showed newborns imitate adults, others have not      We set out to settle the controversy, said Professor Slaughter, who said her study was the largest and the most comprehensive study of its kind to date      Infant response to adult gestures tested      Professor Slaughter and her colleagues tested infant responses to a wide range of adult gestures at one, three, six and nine weeks of age      Adults presented 106 infants with 11 different gestures including tongue poking, mouth opening, finger pointing, and happy and sad facial expressions, as well as sounds like mmm and eee      The infants were exposed to each gesture for 60 seconds during which time the researchers recorded the infants' response      To guard against the infant becoming confused by each gesture they ensured it was quiet, alert and engaged before a new gesture was presented to them      To our surprise we did not find any evidence that babies imitated any of the gestures at any of the time points, Professor Slaughter said      The most common activity among newborns was tongue poking, which they found occurred in response to a number of gestures by the adult      Mouth opening, as well and happy and sad faces, all got the same amount of tongue poking response as did tongue poking itself, Professer Slaughter said      She said there was no doubt older infants could imitate adults, but her findings suggested that babies learn this skill      For those who think this takes some of the magic out of having a child, Professor Slaughter disagreed      I think it's magical and wonderful that from the time babies are born they are interested in other people, and they are ready to learn about how they relate to others around them — in part, by learning to imitate, she said      Professor Slaughter said the findings should come as encouraging news to parents who find their newborns do not imitate them      She said this was certainly the case when she told one mother of a newborn about the research findings      She let out this massive sigh of relief and said: 'Oh thank God, I've been trying and trying to get my newborn baby to imitate She wouldn't do it and I thought there must be something wrong with her', Professor Slaughter said      A 'game changer' - or not?      Developmental psychologist Professor Cheryl Dissanayake, of La Trobe University, said the paper was going to have major impacts on theory, research and teaching in the area of child development and conditions like autism      This is a game changer It's very exciting, she said      None of the studies to date have had this many children or this many gestures included within a strong experimental paradigm      She said the study was also the first longitudinal study to look at imitation in newborns      However not all psychologists are convinced      This isn't a fair test .. In many ways, the authors appear to have set up the infants to fail Dr Elizabeth A Simpson, University of Miami      This paper is far from having solved the controversy of neonatal imitation, said Dr Elizabeth A Simpson, an assistant professor in the University of Miami      Dr Simpson said the study had significant methodological shortcomings      She said some of the modelled actions are actually rare or absent in newborns      If an infant is unable to produce a given action, then of course she will be unable to imitate it This isn't a fair test, Dr Simpson said      The authors also failed to give infants sufficient time to respond, she said      In many ways, the authors appear to have set up the infants to fail, she said      Topics: science-and-technology, parenting, psychology, child-health-and-behaviour, australia, united-states ", "summary": "– Contradicting parenting websites and books—and probably a bunch of overly proud new parents—researchers have concluded that infants in the first weeks of life actually don't imitate facial expressions or hand gestures In fact, the study suggests that it's the adults who are imitating the babies, reports Australia's ABC Over the past decades, some studies have suggested that infants imitate people, while others found no proof (Playing with babies helps them learn to pay attention.)", "summary_all": "– Contradicting parenting websites and books—and probably a bunch of overly proud new parents—researchers have concluded that infants in the first weeks of life actually don't imitate facial expressions or hand gestures In fact, the study suggests that it's the adults who are imitating the babies, reports Australia's ABC Over the past decades, some studies have suggested that infants imitate people, while others found no proof \"We wanted to clear up the confusion because the 'fact' that newborns imitate is widely cited .. in popular sources for parents,\" researcher Virginia Slaughter says in a press release She says the problem with earlier studies is that they looked only at a few gestures, mostly just sticking out the tongue and opening the mouth \"If infants also increase their tongue protrusions when an adult models a happy face or finger pointing, then it's not a case of imitation, but probably excitement at seeing an adult do something interesting,\" Slaughter says \"We eliminated this problem by assessing infants' responses to a wide range of different models.\" The new study, published Thursday, tested 11 gestures on 106 infants between 1 and 9 weeks old What researchers call the \"most comprehensive longitudinal study\" of imitation in infants found no, well, imitation in infants On the other hand, researchers found that parents imitate their baby every two minutes or so (Playing with babies helps them learn to pay attention.)"}

safety, and national security Trade in counterfeit goods funds criminal enterprises.”      One of the largest threats posed by counterfeit goods is consumer safety Fake medicine, for example, often contains the wrong dosage of a certain ingredient or lacks a key ingredient altogether Consumers who purchase counterfeit pharmaceutical products are at risk of being treated incorrectly, of overdose, and even death U.S law enforcement seized 2,401 shipments of counterfeit pharmaceutical and personal care goods in 2016, the sixth most of any product category      While the U.S Food and Drug administration estimates that less than 1% of all drugs in developed countries are fake, counterfeit pharmaceutical products pose a serious danger in the developing world, where certain life-threatening diseases are more prevalent and the authenticity of drugs is all the more important      But it is not just fake pharmaceuticals that pose a serious risk to consumers Any product that does not meet federal safety standards or is manufactured with low quality materials can pose a danger to consumers Counterfeit consumer electronics made with lithium batteries have been known to explode or catch fire      In December 2016, the CBP launched Operation Surge Protector, an initiative focusing on the seizure of fake consumer electronics subject to overheating and igniting Counterfeit hoverboards, for example, have been known to randomly catch fire The CBP seized 108,122 counterfeit hoverboards containing 32,624 illegal batteries in 2016 These hoverboards would be worth $46.4 million had they been genuine      The number of shipments of certain products seized at the border can vary by hundreds and even thousands from year to year As Skinner wrote, “Demand by consumers for particular goods drives the import of goods into the United States Counterfeiters take advantage of this demand.” As consumer tastes and preferences change, so does the flow of fake goods into the country      Nearly 90% of seized counterfeit goods originate in China or Hong Kong According to the Department of Defense, the infiltration of foreign-made counterfeit electronics poses a national security threat For example, it was revealed in 2011 that mission computers of the U.S Missile Defense Agency’s anti-ballistic missile defense and aircraft systems contained over 80,000 counterfeit devices from China The fake products could have resulted in a total system failure or security breach      To determine America’s most counterfeited items, 24/7 Wall St reviewed

{"article_number": 4303, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "MEXICO CITY — In perhaps the clearest sign yet that economic change is gathering pace in Cuba , the government plans to lay off more than half a million people from the public sector in the expectation that they will move into private businesses, Cuba’s labor federation said Monday      Over the past several months, President Raúl Castro has given stern warnings that Cuba’s economy needs a radical overhaul, beginning with its workers With as many as one million excess employees on the state payroll, Mr Castro has said, the government is supporting a bloated bureaucracy that has sapped motivation and long sheltered a huge swath of the nation’s workers      “We have to erase forever the notion that Cuba is the only country in the world where one can live without working,” he told the National Assembly last month      Since permanently taking over from his brother Fidel two years ago, Mr Castro has often pledged to make Cuba’s centralized, Soviet-style economy more efficient and open up opportunities for people The government has handed tens of thousands of acres of state-held farmland to private farmers and begun freeing up a market for agricultural supplies It has loosened restrictions on cellphones and other electronics, and created a few areas for private business, allowing barbers’ shops to become cooperatives and giving more licenses to private taxi drivers      But these initial reforms have been comparatively limited, many analysts contend, and Cuba’s economy — grappling with the fallout from the global financial crisis and the aftermath of devastating hurricanes in 2008 — appears to be in dire shape      Tourism revenues have flagged, the country has faced rice shortages and its sugar crop has been disastrous Last year, as the government tried to hold onto desperately needed hard currency, imports fell by 37 percent      In its statement Monday, the Cuban Workers’ Central, the country’s only recognized labor federation, openly acknowledged the nation’s troubled economy, saying that changes were “necessary and could not be delayed.”      “Cuba faces the urgency to advance economically,” the statement said “Our state cannot and should not continue supporting companies” and other state entities, “with inflated payrolls, losses that damage the economy, which are counterproductive, generate bad habits and deform the workers’ conduct,” the labor federation added      To that end, the government has previously said that it would grant new licenses to entrepreneurs, vastly expanding the kinds of businesses that can be run privately But the announcement on Monday — saying that the layoffs would be completed by next March — suggested that Mr Castro now intended to move ahead vigorously      “What’s stunning today is that they put a date and they put a number on it — 500,000,” said Philip Peters, who follows Cuba for the Lexington Institute “It’s a very substantial decision,” he added “It’s a major shift towards a larger private sector in a socialist economy.”      New openings in the private sector would be welcomed by many Cubans, who are weary of the island’s stagnation and desperate for new opportunities      Even so, the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of jobs — and with them the security of a salary, workplace meals and the chance to make extra money through tips in some cases — would come as a shock      While Cubans have access to free health care, education and subsidized food and housing, the government has already cut some of the subsidies that many Cubans rely on to supplement their average monthly wage of about $20 And given the government’s record of introducing new areas for enterprise only haltingly, it is unclear that new jobs can be created as quickly as the public sector positions will be cut      “They are in the process of massively reducing the size and participation of the state in Cuban life,” said Julia E Sweig, a Cuba expert at the Council on Foreign Relations who was in Havana a couple of weeks ago “There is a belief that there is so much pent-up demand on the one hand and so much skill on the other that the private sector will absorb them pretty rapidly.”      Ms Sweig said that it appeared the government was preparing to open up a vast range of activities, including light manufacturing like furniture making and garment production Cuba’s underground economy already provides a broad array of products, she said, but under the new arrangement the government would begin to tax those new businesses      To absorb all those workers who will be laid off, the federation said that hundreds of thousands were expected to move into some form of private enterprise over the next few years      Just how strongly the government plans to hold onto its traditional economic philosophies are a matter of debate      In an interview published online by the Atlantic last week, Fidel Castro said that the Cuban model no longer worked But in a speech at the University of Havana shortly after his remarks were published, he said that he had been misinterpreted and that what he meant was that capitalism did not work      Ms Sweig, who was present for the first interview, said that Mr Castro’s speech correcting himself was not backtracking Instead, she said his words were most likely intended to reassure Cubans that he did not intend to import American-style capitalism “It is a hybrid that is evolving,” she said      Still, John Kavulich, a senior adviser for the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, warned that it would be difficult for Cuba to follow through on the full scale of its announcement On a practical level, he asked, would the government be able to import all the tools the new entrepreneurs or small manufacturing cooperatives will need?      There is also a larger question that goes to the heart of Cuba’s ideology, Mr Kavulich said “The Cuban government is going to allow and by definition encourage people to go into private sector opportunities,” he said “What happens when some people get rich?”      “The government is going to have to determine whether it will allow and embrace success, not just opportunity,” he said ", "summary": "Now Cuba watchers are split on whether that private sector can absorb Castro's move: \"There is so much pent-up demand on the one hand and so much skill on the other,\" one tells the New York Times, so the transition will happen \"pretty rapidly.” Baloney, says another: \"There is no private sector to absorb them.\" Regardless, Castro said last month: “We have to erase forever the notion that Cuba is the only country in the world where one can live without working.\" For Raul Castro's earlier flirtations with free markets, click here.", "summary_all": "– Cuba's announcement that it's looking to whack a half-million workers off the state payroll by March is a significant move toward capitalism, reports the Wall Street Journal Bearing some 85% of the nation's 5.5 million workers on the government payroll, as well as a ravaged economy, the island nation has little choice but to offload a significant number into the private sector \"Our state can't keep maintaining bloated payrolls,\" said Cuba's national union yesterday Now Cuba watchers are split on whether that private sector can absorb Castro's move: \"There is so much pent-up demand on the one hand and so much skill on the other,\" one tells the New York Times, so the transition will happen \"pretty rapidly.” Baloney, says another: \"There is no private sector to absorb them.\" Regardless, Castro said last month: “We have to erase forever the notion that Cuba is the only country in the world where one can live without working.\" For Raul Castro's earlier flirtations with free markets, click here."}

the Catholic Church warned that the island was on the verge of economic and social disaster if the government didn't quickly make the changes required      Raul Castro has moved cautiously on reforms, but has consistently said the Cuban economy needs an overhaul He has leased state lands and loosened restrictions on farmers buying supplies and selling produce Last month, he foreshadowed Monday's announcement, complaining that the state payroll was burdened with 1 million excess workers      This is survival economics, says Jaime Suchlicki, director of the Institute for Cuban Studies at the University of Miami They don't have liquidity, and have a lousy economy      Laying off government workers, however, is unlikely to do much to solve the country's problems, Mr Suchlicki and others warned, since let-go workers have no where else to turn to earn a living They won't be absorbed by the private sector because there is no private sector to absorb them, he said      The changes were announced shortly after the elder Mr Castro, who heads Cuba's Communist Party, and wields enormous influence on the island, gave a controversial interview to The Atlantic magazine, in which he said the Cuban model no longer worked for any country, much less Cuba Mr Castro later said he had been misunderstood, and it was capitalism that didn't work      The move raised speculation about whether

remain on different sides of the issue But, she added, When global capitalism takes over the world, Fidel's going to be the last man standing, but he's also not going to get in his brother's way      To help workers who are laid off, the union said Cuba will issue thousands more licenses allowing citizens to find work on their own      Cuba said it hoped to move some state workers into sectors that had not attracted much interest in the past, such as policing, teaching and industrial work, the statement said The statement also said Cuba is investing heavily in areas such as oil, tourism and biotechnology where it hoped that future job growth would take place      Job options will be increased and broadened with new forms of nonstate employment, among them leasing land, cooperatives and self-employment, absorbing hundreds of thousands of workers in the coming years, the union statement said      The move to slim down the public sector will create unemployment in the short term, which could create some political turbulence for the government But the result will likely be higher wages for those in the private sector, said Philip Peters, a Cuba expert with the Lexington Institute, a think-tank in Arlington, Va      Citing surveys he has conducted in recent years, Mr Peters said private-sector employees make salaries three times as high as those in comparable public-sector jobs If they carry this thing out fully, it will vastly improve the welfare of thousands of families, he said      It remains to be seen, however, just how many private-sector jobs Cuba can create Cuba now has only 591,000 people working in the private sector, most of them family farmers, as well as another 143,000 workers classified as self-employed, according to government figures      Since Cuba first allowed self-employment in the early 1990s, thousands of Cubans have gone into business, often catering to tourists Privately owned restaurants, known as paladares, emerged to serve visitors, usually in the crumbling but grand old homes of Havana But restrictions on the paladares were so strict in recent years that many have since closed their doors      Cubans who decide to go into business for themselves will find a series of obstacles, including very high taxes, lack of access to credit and foreign exchange, bans on advertising, limits on the number of people they can hire, and a litany of small-print government regulations, experts say      Cuba's government has a list of 124 authorized activities for people who want to employ themselves Among them: Toy repairman, music teacher, piñata salesman and carpenter Carpenters are allowed only to repair existing furniture or make new furniture upon the direct request of a customer They cannot make furniture to sell to the general public      Carmelo Mesa-Lago, an expert on the Cuban economy who is emeritus professor of economics at the University of Pittsburgh says: The question is how many obstacles [the government] will place in front of these people?      A government attempt this year to get Cuban farmers to produce more by allowing them to lease land, has been hampered by an acute lack of fertilizer, farm machinery and herbicides That has made it difficult to cultivate land overrun by a thick, thorny scrub brush called Marabu And earlier this year, Cuba announced big drops in agricultural production despite the land reforms      Economic growth could pick up if Cuba continues to open itself to privatization in coming years, but the process will be a slow one, said Arch Ritter, an economist who studies Cuba at Carleton University in Canada Growth would require a major change in the way the private sector is treated, he says Critical steps would be lowering taxes and loosening regulations for small businesses      Cuba is one of the last true Communist economic systems in the world, a place where the state dominates nearly all spheres of life Foreign investment is restricted to joint ventures with the government and limited to some sectors like tourism and oil      After running up a huge current-account deficit in 2009, Cuba has had to cut back sharply on its imports, including critical inputs for agriculture and manufacturing That has driven down agricultural and industrial production To save money, Cuba stopped foreign joint ventures from repatriating profits      In recent years, Cuba has largely depended on nickel exports, tourism and an estimated $5 billion a year in subsidies from Venezuela's ideologically sympathetic government to get by But tourism has been flat, nickel prices fell sharply last year, and many question how long Mr Castro's ally, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, can afford to ship close to 100,000 barrels a day of oil products to the island The oil is partly a payment for the services of Cuban doctors and other professions working in Venezuela      Cuba's previous attempt at reform, in the 1990s, didn't last long On the verge of collapse following the end of Soviet subsidies, Cuba allowed the U.S dollar to circulate, opened itself to foreign investment and issued licenses allowing Cubans to find work outside the state sector But as Cuba regained its economic footing, foreign investment was limited, and self-employment was rolled back as the state heavily taxed would be entrepreneurs, making many of them give up their licenses because they were too expensive to maintain      Write to Jose de Cordoba at jose.decordoba@wsj.com and Nicholas Casey at nicholas.casey@wsj.com ", "summary": "– Cuba's announcement that it's looking to whack a half-million workers off the state payroll by March is a significant move toward capitalism, reports the Wall Street Journal Bearing some 85% of the nation's 5.5 million workers on the government payroll, as well as a ravaged economy, the island nation has little choice but to offload a significant number into the private sector \"Our state can't keep maintaining bloated payrolls,\" said Cuba's national union yesterday", "summary_all": "– Cuba's announcement that it's looking to whack a half-million workers off the state payroll by March is a significant move toward capitalism, reports the Wall Street Journal Bearing some 85% of the nation's 5.5 million workers on the government payroll, as well as a ravaged economy, the island nation has little choice but to offload a significant number into the private sector \"Our state can't keep maintaining bloated payrolls,\" said Cuba's national union yesterday Now Cuba watchers are split on whether that private sector can absorb Castro's move: \"There is so much pent-up demand on the one hand and so much skill on the other,\" one tells the New York Times, so the transition will happen \"pretty rapidly.” Baloney, says another: \"There is no private sector to absorb them.\" Regardless, Castro said last month: “We have to erase forever the notion that Cuba is the only country in the world where one can live without working.\" For Raul Castro's earlier flirtations with free markets, click here."}

secretive cults was preying upon day care children for sex and other horrors      The Kellers also were harmed, he argued, by the combined efforts of inept therapists, gullible police and an

{"article_number": 1253, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": " Starting in 1998 with “Pi,” Darren Aronofsky has directed, with mixed results, a series of dazzling and confrontational movies that combine visual virtuosity with intense probings of dark psychological themes His new film, “Mother!,” follows suit It’s a horror story about the beleaguered wife of a narcissistic writer and includes some remarkable visions of hell on Earth      Aronofsky’s movies are not for everyone — provocations like “Requiem for a Dream” and “Black Swan” can feel assaultive, a deliberate test of audience endurance Viewers willing to accept the challenge will be rewarded with passages embodying extraordinary moods and images      In “Mother!” Jennifer Lawrence (who, in real life, is romantically involved with the director) plays an unnamed woman who lives in a large, remote house with a blocked poet (Javier Bardem), also unnamed, and spends much of her time fixing up the place, which was the site of a catastrophic fire Some disquieting notes of marital discord are sounded, one of which involves her hope to become pregnant      A stranger (Ed Harris) knocks at the door He claims to be a doctor, though he smokes and suffers a hacking cough He turns out to be a fan of the poet, who generously invites him to stay, against his wife’s wishes This is the first instance of what will become one of the film’s major points, the wife’s increasing sense of encroachment, her loss of boundaries And it’s only the beginning      Another visitor (Michelle Pfeiffer) shows up, the wife of the Harris character, and she is even worse — a hard-drinking harridan with a bad attitude about her hostess Next up are the violently quarreling sons of the Harris and Pfeiffer characters It’s a nightmare situation, but the Bardem character doesn’t see why He says they just need to be generous to their “guests.”      It’s hard to believe that Aronofsky does not have “Rosemary’s Baby” in mind as he recounts the Lawrence character’s growing sense of paranoia and isolation No one seems to understand why she’s upset about what amounts to a home invasion, one that’s going to reach apocalyptic dimensions The outsiders are rude, destructive, menacing figures who sneer at her concerns      Are they anything but projections of the poet’s intense selfishness? The scores and hundreds of guests all seem to worship his books, and he feels obliged to be nice to them The Bardem character is an artist incapable of loving anyone but himself; nothing matters apart from his work and its acceptance by the world      The movie has its share of wicked comedy, but it nevertheless builds to an over-the-top climax that’s a frightening image of the outbreak of collectivist madness overwhelming the individual The invaders are reminiscent of “Rosemary’s Baby’s” Satanists, but lacking even a pretense of a civilized veneer      Aronofky gets exactly what he needs from his top-notch cast Lawrence is appealing and never allows herself to be reduced simply to a howling victim Bardem, Harris and Pfeiffer are menacing in their own varying ways, with Bardem capable of turning on the charm at key times that makes us wonder if we haven’t misjudged him      In short, if you’re game for it, “Mother!” is another of Aronofsky’s ominous extravaganzas      Walter Addiego is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer Email: waddiego@sfchronicle.com      Mother!

Written by Darren Aronofsky Directed by Darren Aronofsky Starring Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer Genre Horror Classification 18A Country USA Language English Year 2017      ★ for the Aronofsky agnostic      ★★★★ for the Aronofsky acolyte      In the beginning, so we're told, God created the heavens and the earth In the beginning of Mother!, Darren Aronofsky creates a heaven on earth      Paradise here is a massive octagonal wooden home in the middle of the countryside, inhabited by a nameless woman (Jennifer Lawrence), who has spent who knows how long sprucing it up, and her similarly anonymous poet husband (Javier Bardem), who's spent the same amount of time struggling with writer's block The two are in love – or so each of them professes – and their days are filled with leisurely meals, lazy wanderings from room to room and furtive glances at the giant, mysterious crystal the husband keeps in his study      Story continues below advertisement      Until one day, when a stranger (Ed Harris) comes knocking at the door He's looking for help, and the husband takes a shine to him The woman – she's not quite sure of the man's intentions Soon enough, the stranger's arrival is followed by that of his drunken, overtly sexual wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) And then their two warring sons (Brian Gleeson and Domhnall Gleeson) show up And then – well, all hell breaks loose In an extraordinarily literal sense      And this is where Mother! either falls apart or opens up a chasm so wide that it threatens to swallow the theatre whole Which is what happens when a filmmaker decides to play God – and make no mistake, Mother! is Aronofsky's very own creation myth, a profoundly upsetting and furious apology for what he considers humanity's original sin: existence      If that sounds grandiose, it is nothing compared with the gonzo experiment Aronofsky has devised Up to this point, the marketing campaign for Mother! has been light on details, heavy on atmosphere Perhaps you've seen the trailers and assumed the film was a modern spin on Rosemary's Baby or The Shining – an eerie thriller centred on a young woman whose better half succumbs to some unspeakable evil That log line is true in a sense But there is so much more to Mother! – and also so much less      Without wading too deep into spoiler waters, Mother! is a tale of what happens when a creative mind is given unfettered power and destroys almost everything in his (or His) wake That indictment applies to both Bardem's character, who takes and takes from Lawrence's put-upon wife without giving her anything in return, and Aronofsky himself, who mines a history of genre tropes only to dismantle everything cinema stands for In 121 minutes, the writer-director creates a vision that is equal parts horror, satire, polemic and sheer abomination      For those devout members of the Church of Aronofsky – basically, anyone who has stuck with the auteur since catching Requiem for a Dream on cable when they were 14 and realizing that movies could be as scuzzy and dangerous as the mind's own limits – Mother! is a masterpiece A frenzied plunge into Aronofsky's deepest fears and humanity's darkest temptations, it can be viewed as the latest escalation in the director's bombastic aesthetic, all chaos and carnage      For those who remain skeptical of Aronofsky's previous efforts (even his most mainstream film, The Wrestler, is mired in darkness), Mother! will spark instant revulsion, even charges of heresy Here he goes again, screeching into the megaphone like a grad student leading his first march on insert-corrupt-institution-here Aronofsky is never one to whisper, but he shouts so often that he risks losing his voice entirely      Yet even those who find themselves sitting between these two camps are guaranteed to walk away from Mother! feeling … something Perhaps enlightenment Or outrage Or just a general sense of gobsmacked disbelief By uniting the themes of his entire filmography – Pi's obsession with the secrets of the Almighty, Black Swan's focus on the damage done to female bodies for the sake of the male ego, Noah's belief that God is a cruel and jealous creator – and wrapping them in barbed-wire visuals engineered to churn the most cynical viewer's stomach, the director has reached peak Aronofsky      Story continues below advertisement      Story continues below advertisement      Mother! is an unparalleled achievement, entirely unprecedented and unexpected in this era of studio filmmaking However Aronofsky convinced Paramount to fund this film and roll it out in wide release is an act of God itself, a true modern miracle By the time, about three-quarters in, that Lawrence's character suffers an unimaginable betrayal – followed, not one minute later, by an even more horrifying twist of the knife – it is impossible to deny Aronofsky's sheer audacity, as well as the gall of those who funded such fearlessness      The world is lucky to have Mother!

{"article_number": 1253, "article_idx": 4, "article_text": " Women give, men take and the Old Testament crashes into modern anxiety in director Darren Aronofsky's mother!  It is an audacious, bold and fascinating fever dream of a film It's allegory for, well, everything (the environment, marriage, art, spirituality, you name it!), that will challenge, distress and edify anyone who chooses to submit themselves to this creation for two hours      Like many Aronofsky endeavors, mother! is a film doesn't fit neatly into one genre It starts out as one thing, a sort of psychological thriller and chamber drama about a couple living in a stately and remote home, and devolves gradually and then very suddenly into jaw-dropping chaos that almost seems to be testing the viewer How much of Jennifer Lawrence's suffering can you take before covering your eyes? Or storming out of the theater? Mother! will get under your skin, that's a guarantee      This film begs for a viewing unencumbered by lengthy summarization It's not that it defies explanation, what happens is fairly straightforward as far as nightmare logic is concerned But the less you know the better      The setting is a grand Victorian home, plopped down in the middle of a field surrounded by trees There lives a married couple (Lawrence and Javier Bardem), and it is peaceful and bright It is an Eden dressed in Restoration Hardware linens that Lawrence's character (who is credited as Mother but never called that) has rebuilt for her husband (credited as Him) from wall to wall after a devastating fire burned it to the ground She is earthy and quiet and perches her head to the wall to listen to the beating heart of the home in order to find the right shade of yellow for the space      And then one night, a strange man (Ed Harris) comes to the door Bardem's character, a famous poet suffering from extreme writer's block, invites him in, and the paradise Mother has so painstakingly created begins to crumble The next day, the man's wife (a wickedly funny Michelle Pfeiffer) shows up too Mother, while trying to be polite and a good hostess and still continue restoring her house, is also understandably bewildered by the sudden changes and her own husband's apparent disinterest in her objections to these strangers occupying their home      For all the stress and anxiety that mother! will inspire in viewers, this section is really quite funny, human and relatable as Mother grapples with her absent husband and rude houseguests who drink their liquor and break their valuables and ask invasive questions about why she doesn't yet have children      It is a host's worst nightmare, and it only gets worse for poor Mother — the only sane person around who of course is predestined to be driven crazy by everyone else Aronofsky has a special appreciation for hyperbolic depictions of female madness and suffering, whether it's an aging woman looking to lose a few pounds in Requiem for a Dream, a ballerina striving for perfection in Black Swan, or a wife just looking to make an impeccable home for the person she loves in mother!      It is a tense and exciting film — one of Aronofsky's best — and Lawrence has never been better Hers is a truly stunning and elevated performance full of beauty, empathy and rage at her own powerlessness and the greed and apathy spiraling out of control around her      Mother! demands to be seen more than once, and afterward discussed and dissected I'd also recommend taking a look at the credits to see the names of the other characters who come into their lives      My heart has not stopped its anxious pounding, nor my head from spinning since seeing this film      Mother, may I have a Xanax?      mother! a Paramount Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for strong disturbing violent content, some sexuality, nudity and language Running time: 121 minutes Three and a half stars out of four      ___      MPAA Definition of R: Restricted Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian      ___      Follow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr ", "summary": "But Lindsey Bahr calls the movie \"one of Aronofsky's best.\" It's \"an audacious, bold and fascinating fever dream of a film\" and an \"allegory for, well, everything,\" she writes at the AP It \"will get under your skin, that's a guarantee,\" but the film also has moments that are \"funny, human and relatable,\" writes Bahr, crediting Lawrence's \"truly stunning\" performance", "summary_all": "– Darren Aronofsky's psychological drama Mother!

No split there, then – or is that premature? Read on      Splendid isolation was a celebrated British boast in the late-Victorian era, but that was then, when the British Empire was still – just about – the leading world power Within a few years, London was drawn into defensive alliances to resist the rise of Germany and the stage was set for two bloody world wars, punctuated by the Great Depression      So is today's isolation splendid or miserable? Is it better or for worse? Well, plenty are dashing on to radio and TV to assert both options with glib over-confidence In refusing to join the emerging fiscal union Cameron has forced the EU majority to create what are known as inter-governmental arrangements, not formal EU arrangements Paris and Berlin will not be pleased      Yet I do not hear the sound of champagne corks or celebration among British Eurosceptics Beware of what you wish for, is a wise saying Who knows what happens now? But Europe, for all its follies and failings, has become a scapegoat for weaknesses that are really our own We may be about to rediscover that awkward truth It was why we joined in the first place      As Nick Watt reports overnight from the Belgian capital, the break point for Cameron (who kept Nick Clegg and George Osborne in touch) was the need to protect the British financial services industry – our equivalent of BMW and Mercedes Benz, 10% of the UK economy – in ways the EU majority do not want to      They want to scapegoat the banks, in Europe and the US, for their problems Banks are very culpable, but their poor risk-assessment policies and arrogance are not the cause of the eurozone's crisis: the zone was poorly constructed in the first place, a triumph of hope over experience      A French diplomat is quoted as saying that Britain had come to the summit like a man attending a wife-swapping party without bringing his own wife along An interesting comparison that one, which suggests that Dominique Strauss-Kahn's corrupting influence in French public life may be even wider than appreciated      But the analogy doesn't work Paris has always left its wife – the common agricultural policy – at home, she's got a headache It bends rules it devised when it suits its needs, always did: check it out In wanting to stuff the City of London it was bringing along someone else's: ours      Never mind, a British moneyman has just boasted on the radio that Britain's refusal to join the newly integrated fiscal union means it has just avoided boarding the Titanic My personal prejudice lies that way, too – I can't see the democratic politics or the growth-denying economics of the eurozone working over the long haul – but I am not so confident as chummy is that we are right      The Germans may be right, they may impose their will on France and other weaker neighbours or insist that transactions denominated in euros must be conducted within the eurozone, bad for the City But they may also be wrong – the details of the very urgent eurozone bailout are far from complete and markets are falling – but the process of finding out will damage us as well as them The Chinese will be watching scornfully      Pro-European thinktank buff Charles Grant is on BBC Radio 4 saying it's a bad day for Britain which is left with only Hungary as its sole ally on the fringe of Europe – not a good place, to be sure Actually, the Czechs and the Swedes (always a significant player) have not signed up either As I say, it's very unclear at this stage      Cameron has played a weak hand badly, says Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, Douglas Alexander He's failed to nurture allies (remember, how he and William Hague walked out of the Euro-Tory group, the EPP, at Strasbourg?), he refused to help fund the Greek bailout and told Angela Merkel only last March that he didn't want to be in the room when the eurozone's problems were under discussion      Well, he won't be now, even though he's changed his mind The official position of British ministers – Hague has just been on air, too – is that if the 23 (or group of 25?) want to do things they can't use the EU's official machinery because the fiscal union is not a European Union matter, but an intergovernmental one, as France, the champion of nation states (especially its own), prefers      There will be a lot of fuss about such principles and practices, but it won't hold There is now a two-speed Europe, a Europe of variable geometry, as Hague has just explained There are lots of just such examples, the Schengen agreement on border control (not working very well) or the Anglo-French defence co-operation agreement Life will go on, he says      Hague may not be crowing because he's got what he always wanted and Lady Thatcher would want too if she's still watching TV: a free-trade relationship with Europe, a bit like Switzerland, one Tory MP – the wonderfully named Mark Reckless – suggests Not crowing will make it easier for Clegg and Co to bite the bullet Ming Campbell's soothing words on BBC Radio 4's Today programme suggests it won't be too hard: power binds them in      We'll find out some of the answers in the coming days and weeks – as well as the more important issue of whether the necessary steps are being taken to shore up the weaker members of the eurozone My hunch is that they have not done it      The financial muscle of the German surpluses has not yet been deployed to protect the borrowers, the Germans still want their money back The European Central Bank is not yet the lender of last resort with the monopoly power to print electronic money and float the zone – and us – off the rocks of recession Or do I mean the iceberg?      Is the European commission weakened, bypassed even, by what is in the process of being sewn up in its home city this weekend? Is the single market – central to Britain's vision of a free-trade Europe, looking outward to the world – weakened too? France and Germany do not share that Anglo-Saxon preference      These issues are far bigger than our domestic politics But they matter, too I cannot see how the Eurosceptic Thatcherite right, which does not like or trust David Cameron, can do anything other than praise him for standing firm and protecting his vision of British sovereignty How much British sovereignty will prove to be worth remains to be seen      There again, they praised John Major's opt-out negotiation at Maastricht, too – at the start      Labour will support the outcome but say that coalition carelessness forced Cameron into a binary choice that better diplomacy could have avoided Ed Miliband will be right about that, but it will not make much difference Public opinion, the bombastic faction and the tabloids will be pleased; for now The dilemma is the Lib Dems' dilemma A lot of people in the party, MPs and ministers too, will be very very unhappy      Even David Owen – ex-Labour foreign secretary and SDP leader – who is brilliant but erratic, says he is unhappy, though he too opposed the euro We didn't vote for this Cameron had no mandate to isolate us, he is already saying Lord Owen has no army to lead But he remains formidable and will be talking to others      If there are any Lib Dem ministers unhappy with the coalition, fired up with principle or ambition, now would be the time to do a Robin Cook and resign with maximum impact I have not a scintilla of evidence to suggest Chris Huhne may be thinking hard today He is clever, ambitious and pro-European The Tories are being nasty about his green policies, the brutes, and he has unresolved issues over speeding points with the Essex constabulary      Just a thought ", "summary": "– David Cameron's decision to exercise Britain's veto and sit out negotiations on a new EU treaty is being seen as a momentous move, even if the ramifications aren't quite clear yet: New York Times: The decision \"has left Britain as isolated as it has ever been in postwar Europe and effectively left out of future European decisions,\" write Sarah Lyall and Julia Werdigier They add, however, that \"there was widespread confusion over what this all actually means.\" Guardian: \"I do not hear the sound of champagne corks or celebration among British Eurosceptics,\" writes Michael White \"Beware of what you wish for, is a wise saying Who knows what happens now?

{"article_number": 3909, "article_idx": 2, "article_text": " From my Morning Briefing email, sent out by 8.30am each weekday – sign up here      William Hague on the Today Programme, discussing David Cameron's decision to veto the EU deal (details below): We have created world market confidence We do that by controlling our own affairs He stressed that Britain is not changing the terms of treaties and refused to say that Britain would be isolated      He said that Nick Clegg had absolutely agreed the decision to use the veto, but ruled out a referendum There are many different overlapping groups of cooperation, this is one of them… The important thing at the moment is for the eurozone to be stabilised, for the european economies to start growing again, and for Britain to defend its national interest      Mr Hague also refused to answer whether Britain could be involved in an IMF bailout We are always involved in increasing the resources of the IMF he said, but he said that the IMF is about the world economy, not the EU We won't agree an uplift [to our IMF contribution] to help the eurozone he added      VETO WIELDED      The veto has been wielded and David Cameron has presumably snuck off to bed – we've got a few hours before the EU summit meetings kick off, and the Prime Minister looked exhausted at his press conference at 5.30am (UK time) Now it's time for the rest of us to digest the deal he's (not) reached      The main point is that Britain has vetoed the deal proposed by Germany and France and so will stay outside of any treaty changes Instead, France and Germany will lead the 17 eurozone countries and six stringers in a new treaty Britain is left outside with Hungary, and with Sweden and Czech Republic, who are consulting their parliaments      Speaking earlier, Mr Cameron said that: What is on offer isn't in Britain's interest so I didn't agree He added: I had to pursue very doggedly what was in Britain's interests, which is very difficult in a room where people are pressing you to sign up to things because they say it is in all our interests He ruled out surrenders of sovereignty and new rounds of integration      In his own press conference, an hour before Dave's, Nicolas Sarkozy said that Britain had made unacceptable demands The big fight was between Sarkozy and Cameron over exemptions from financial regulations (it's not clear which yet), hence the narrower deal      The French are very angry – one French diplomat says that Britain is acting like a man who wants to go to a wife-swapping party without taking his own wife So too are the Europeans The FT quotes an EU official who says this is going to cost the UK dearly – they have antagonised everyone      But the big question now is what will the 23 be able to do? Dave insists that he will stop them using EU institutions, a position backed by Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission President But if the result is new institutions for the 23 (or the 25), then this looks less like a two-speed Europe and more like British withdrawal      Certainly, it's no surprise that Mark Reckless, the incredibly eurosceptic MP, was on Today earlier heaping praise on the PM Now we can be more like Switzerland, he said Was that the plan?      WHAT THIS MEANS      This morning's news will be a shock to those used to hearing British prime ministers threaten a veto but never use it As William Hague said earlier, the Prime Minister has done exactly what he said he would do: block a proposal that threatens Britain But where does it leave us?      For starters, Edward Leigh owes Mr Cameron an apology, and a grovelling one at that (yesterday, the Tory MP compared Dave to Chamberlain) Beyond that, all is uncertainty His decision puts the Coalition under immediate strain For Britain to step out of the European consensus, to set itself apart, is a blow to core Lib Dem beliefs How will Nick Clegg react?      Certainly, it looks like it will be difficult to reconcile the Cabinet As Patrick Wintour details here , Vince Cable was calling for the Prime Minister to agree to a deal of the 27 even if meant sacrificing the interests of the City Meanwhile, five Tory ministers, led by Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, want the PM to explain how he will renegotiate Britain's position in the medium term      Mr Cameron was right to reject a deal designed by the French, for the French At the heart of this dispute is France's desire to see Britain out of the EU, and the City marginalised That was why they loaded the package with elements Britain could not accept Downing Street officials are clear about what the French are up to, and why the Prime Minister had no choice but to say non      BACKBENCHERS      Then there is the reaction of Tory backbenchers Mr Leigh and his friends are unlikely to waste time clapping Dave on the back They will demand more, no doubt a comprehensive renegotiation of British relations with the EU      How will Mr Cameron manage those forces? He is meeting a group of his backbenchers at Chequers tonight, but he won't be able to ward off the demands for a referendum before his statement to Parliament on Monday      I blogged yesterday that if it was an E17 deal, Downing Street was ready to press for EU institutions – Commission, ECJ – to be respected, and therefore Britain's voice to be respected What about the wider point? How do the US and China view us this morning? We stand alone – and now what? This is a pivotal moment that is about far more than an internal Tory ding-dong      ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE      Then there is the question that matters most: where does Britain stand in the EU and globally? What happens to the euro? Is the E17 a remotely credible proposition? Moody's has downgraded three French banks this morning – hardly a good sign This morning, Italian 10 year bond yields are back over 7 per cent, as traders presumably wonder whether this deal will lead to any action from the ECB      As Fraser Nelson notes in his column today (and in a blog post this morning), this deal isn't anything to do with saving Europe The European Union is being redesigned, and the French and Germans are quietly ticking off their wishlist They have long wanted to bind the eurozone closer together, with similar rules on tax and spending      Yesterday, Philip Hollobone won an award for the silliest comment of the day, when he said that we need to have a disorderly breakup of the euro to boost growth George Osborne disagrees The Times has splashed on the Chancellor's comments to the Lords Economics Affairs Committee yesterday; George reckons that a eurozone breakup could cause a 7 per cent contraction of GDP, or the worst since the 1920s ", "summary": "Cameron was right to reject a deal designed by the French, for the French,\" blogs Benedict Brogan \"At the heart of this dispute is France's desire to see Britain out of the EU, and (London) marginalized That was why they loaded the package with elements Britain could not accept Downing Street officials are clear about what the French are up to, and why the Prime Minister had no choice but to say non.\"", "summary_all": "– David Cameron's decision to exercise Britain's veto and sit out negotiations on a new EU treaty is being seen as a momentous move, even if the ramifications aren't quite clear yet: New York Times: The decision \"has left Britain as isolated as it has ever been in postwar Europe and effectively left out of future European decisions,\" write Sarah Lyall and Julia Werdigier They add, however, that \"there was widespread confusion over what this all actually means.\" Guardian: \"I do not hear the sound of champagne corks or celebration among British Eurosceptics,\" writes Michael White \"Beware of what you wish for, is a wise saying Who knows what happens now?

(Associated Press)      Petraeus, who led U.S military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned his CIA post Friday, acknowledging his extramarital affair with his biographer-turned-lover and expressing deep regret The scandal has rocked Washington, where members of Congress demanded to know why a months-long probe that ended the former general's storied career was kept quiet for so long      Petraeus told associates his relationship with the second woman, Tampa socialite Jill Kelley, was platonic, though his lover Paula Broadwell apparently saw her as a romantic rival The retired general also denied to these associates that he had given Broadwell any of the sensitive military information alleged to have been found on her computer, saying anything she had must have been provided by other commanders during her reporting trips to Afghanistan      The associates spoke Monday on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the matters, which could be part of an FBI investigation      Meanwhile, FBI agents appeared at Broadwell's Charlotte, North Carolina, home Monday night and appeared to be conducting a search An FBI spokeswoman confirmed the agents' presence but did not say what they were doing      New details of the investigation emerged as President Barack Obama hunted for a new CIA director      Kelley, the Tampa woman, began receiving harassing emails in May, according to two federal law enforcement officials They, too, spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter The emails led Kelley to report the matter, eventually triggering the investigation that led Petraeus to resign as head of the intelligence agency      FBI agents traced the alleged cyber harassment to Broadwell, the officials said, and discovered she was exchanging intimate messages with a private gmail account Further investigation revealed the account belonged to Petraeus under an alias      Petraeus and Broadwell apparently used a trick, known to terrorists and teenagers alike, to conceal their email traffic, one of the law enforcement officials said      Rather than transmitting emails to the other's inbox, they composed at least some messages and instead of transmitting them, left them in a draft folder or in an electronic dropbox, the official said Then the other person could log onto the same account and read the draft emails there This avoids creating an email trail that is easier to trace      Broadwell had co-authored a biography titled All In: The Education of General David Petraeus, published in January In the preface, she said she had met Petraeus in the spring of 2006 while she was a graduate student at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and she ended up following him on multiple trips to Afghanistan as part of her research      But the contents of the email exchanges between Petraeus and Broadwell suggested to FBI agents that their relationship was intimate The FBI concluded relatively quickly _ by late summer at the latest _ that no security breach had occurred, the two senior law enforcement officials said But the FBI continued its investigation into whether Petraeus had any role in the harassing emails      Petraeus, 60, told one former associate he began an affair with Broadwell, 40, a couple of months after he became the director of the CIA late last year They mutually agreed to end the affair four months ago, but they kept in contact because she was still writing a dissertation on his time commanding U.S troops overseas, the associate said      FBI agents contacted Petraeus, and he was told that sensitive, possibly classified documents related to Afghanistan were found on her computer He assured investigators they did not come from him, and he mused to his associates that they were probably given to her on her reporting trips to Afghanistan by commanders she visited in the field there The FBI concluded there was no security breach      One associate also said Petraeus believes the documents described past operations and had already been declassified, although they might have still been marked as secret Broadwell had high security clearances on her own as part of her job as a reserve Army major working for military intelligence But those clearances are only in effect when a soldier is on active duty, which she was not at the time she researched the Petraeus biography      During a talk last month at the University of Denver, Broadwell caught attention when she said the CIA had detained people at a secret facility in Benghazi, Libya, and the Sept 11 attack on the U.S Consulate and CIA base there was an effort to free those prisoners      Obama issued an executive order in January 2009 stripping the CIA of its authority to take prisoners The move meant the CIA was forbidden from operating secret jails across the globe as it had under President George W Bush      CIA spokesman Preston Golson said: Any suggestion that the agency is still in the detention business is uninformed and baseless      Broadwell did not say who told her about CIA activities in Libya The video of Broadwell's speech was viewed on YouTube      A Petraeus associate said the retired general was shocked to find out about Broadwell's emails to Kelley Petraeus was not shown the messages, but investigators told him the emails told Kelley to stay away from the general in a threatening tone      Petraeus told former staffers and friends that he was friends with Kelley and her surgeon husband, Scott, and regularly visited their brick home with imposing white columns overlooking Tampa Bay      Jill Kelley, 37, served as a sort of social ambassador for U.S Central Command, hosting parties for the general when Petraeus was commander there from 2008-2010      A photo shows Petraeus and his wife, Holly, with the Kelleys and Jill's identical twin sister Natalie Khawam in the Kelleys' front yard, decked out in party beads with a pirate flag in the background The sisters _ hard to differentiate in the picture with their matching long dark locks and black dresses _ also competed in a cook-off filmed for a Food Network show called Food Fight in 2003      Jill Kelley regularly kept in touch with then-Gen Petraeus when he became commander of the Afghan war effort, the two exchanging near-daily emails and instant messages, two of his former staffers say But those messages were exchanged in accounts that his aides monitored as part of their duties and were not romantic in tone, the staffers said      Kelley did not answer the door at her Tampa home Monday morning, and later left her home by car without talking to reporters The Kelleys hired Abbe Lowell, a Washington lawyer who has represented well-known clients including lobbyist Jack Abramoff and former presidential candidate John Edwards, and released a statement Sunday through a Washington-based crisis management firm that she and her family had been friends with the Petraeus family for five years and wanted to respect their privacy      Petraeus and his family are devastated over the affair, especially Mrs Petraeus, who is not exactly pleased right now, after 38 years of marriage, said Steve Boylan, a friend and former Petraeus spokesman who spoke to him over the weekend      Furious would be an understatement, Boylan told ABC television's Good Morning America The couple has two adult children, including a son who led an infantry platoon in Afghanistan as an Army lieutenant      Broadwell is married with two young sons and lives in Charlotte, North Carolina She has not returned phone calls or emails seeking comment      As the criminal investigation continued into the emails to Kelley, FBI Director Robert Mueller and eventually Attorney General Eric Holder were notified that agents had uncovered what appeared to be an extramarital affair involving Petraeus, said one of the law enforcement officials      Broadwell and Petraeus have each been questioned by FBI agents twice in recent weeks, with both acknowledging the affair in separate interviews The FBI's most recent interviews with Broadwell and with Petraeus both occurred during the week of Oct 29, days before the election, one of the law enforcement officials said The FBI notified Obama's director of national intelligence, James Clapper, of the investigation on Tuesday, Nov 6, Election Day      Clapper called Petraeus that night and urged him to resign Clapper informed the White House late Wednesday, and aides informed the president Thursday morning, before Petraeus came to personally hand in his resignation letter      Some members of Congress are questioning why they weren't told sooner Democratic Sen Dianne Feinstein of California, who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she wants to investigate why she had to find out from news reports Friday      But there were at least a couple of members of Congress who heard inklings of the affair before the election Republican Rep Dave Reichert of Washington state received a tip from an FBI source that the CIA director was involved in an affair in late October Reichert arranged for an associate of his source at the FBI to call House Majority Leader Eric Cantor on Saturday, Oct 27, according to Cantor spokesman Rory Cooper      The FBI agent who contacted Reichert was the same one who first received the allegations from Kelley, a federal law enforcement official said Monday night That agent's role in the case consisted simply of passing along information from Kelley to the FBI agents who conducted the investigation, but that agent was subsequently told by his superiors to steer clear of the case because they grew concerned that the agent had become obsessed with the investigation, the official said The agent was a friend of Kelley and long before the case involving Petraeus got under way, the agent had sent Kelley shirtless photos of himself, according to this official The Wall Street Journal first reported that this FBI agent was kept away from the case      Cooper told The Associated Press Monday that Cantor notified the FBI's chief of staff of the conversation but did not tell anyone else because he did not know whether the information from a person he didn't know was credible      Two weeks ago, you don't want to start spreading something you can't confirm, Cooper said      The FBI responded by telling Cantor's office that it could not confirm or deny an investigation, but assured the leader's office it was acting to protect national security Cooper said Cantor believed that if the information was accurate and national security was affected, the FBI would, as obligated, inform the congressional intelligence committees and others, including House Speaker John Boehner      One of the law enforcement officials who spoke to the AP said long-standing Justice Department policy and practice is not to share information from an ongoing criminal investigation with anyone outside the department, including the White House and Congress The official said national security must be involved to notify Capitol Hill, and that was not the case in the Petraeus matter      Petraeus' affair with Broadwell will be the subject of meetings Wednesday involving congressional intelligence committee leaders, FBI deputy director Sean Joyce and CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell      Petraeus had been scheduled to appear before congressional committees on Thursday to testify about the Benghazi attack that killed four Americans, including U.S Ambassador Chris Stevens Morell is expected to testify in place of Petraeus      Feinstein and others didn't rule out the possibility that Congress will try to compel Petraeus to testify about Benghazi at a later date, even though he has relinquished his CIA job      ___      Yost reported from Washington Associated Press writers Nedra

{"article_number": 2322, "article_idx": 2, "article_text": " Exclusive      Broadwell’s notes to Jill Kelley were full of ‘cat-fight stuff,’ a source tells Michael Daly—but there were no overt threats, and Petraeus was barely mentioned So why did the FBI jump in?      The emails that Jill Kelley showed an FBI friend near the start of last summer were not jealous lover warnings like “stay away from my man,” a knowledgeable source tells The Daily Beast      The messages were instead what the source terms “kind of cat-fight stuff.”      “More like, ‘Who do you think you are? … You parade around the base … You need to take it down a notch,’” according to the source, who was until recently at the highest levels of the intelligence community and prefers not to be identified by name      The base described is MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, where Kelley serves as an unpaid “social liaison.” The source reports that the emails did make one reference to Gen David Petraeus, but it was oblique and offered no manifest suggestion of a personal relationship or even that he was central to the sender’s spite      Kelley herself seemed mystified as to what was behind the emails, much less who sent them      “I don’t know who this person is and I don’t want to keep getting them,” she told the FBI, as recounted by the source      When the FBI friend showed the emails to the cyber squad in the Tampa field office, her fellow agents noted that the absence of any overt threats      “No, ‘I’ll kill you’ or ‘I'll burn your house down,’” the source says “It doesn’t seem really that bad.”      The squad was not even sure the case was worth pursuing, the source says      “What does this mean? There’s no threat there This is against the law?” the agents asked themselves by the source’s account      At most the messages were harassing The cyber squad had to consult the statute books in its effort to determine whether there was adequate legal cause to open a case      Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

You are now subscribed to the Daily Digest and Cheat Sheet We will not share your email with anyone for any reason      “It was a close call,” the source says      What tipped it may have been Kelley’s friendship with the agent The squad opened a case, though with no expectation it would turn into anything significant      “They weren’t seeing this as the crime of the century,” the source says      And certainly nobody was looking to do anything that might cause a huge fuss and maybe get them bounced from Tampa The field office there is a $35 million palace with a second-floor fitness center whose plate-glass windows overlook Tampa Bay, and an eating area that includes an outdoor, screened-in extension for fed al fresco The closest agents get to that in, say, cold and grimy New York is eating in their cars      The agents soon determined that the emails were coming from Paula Broadwell They then would have had to consult with the U.S Attorney’s office in order to secure a search warrant enabling them to go into Broadwell’s email      They apparently did so and are said to have found a number of nonclassified documents that seemed to have originated with Petraeus but had not been sent by an account bearing his name And yet they did not seem to have been forwarded from anywhere      The agents then determined that Broadwell and Petraeus had been communicating with each other via private email accounts As the Associated Press reported on Monday, the pair would save unsent messages in their inboxes, and then log into each other's account to read them      “She really knows him,” the agents told themselves, by the source’s account      The question then was the nature of the connection      “What it was and most importantly what it wasn’t,” the source says      Some of the steamier messages made clear that it was an affair The besotted Broadwell may have viewed the curvaceous Kelley as a threat Broadwell may be able to run a six-minute mile with Petraeus, but Kelley looks like a woman who lets the guys do all the running—and in her direction      Maybe Broadwell chanced to encounter Kelley on some occasion and felt snubbed Or Broadwell could have just seen online photos of Petraeus and his wife visiting the mansion that Kelley shares with her doctor husband and three young children Kelley likely assisted her 7-year-old daughter, Caroline, in posting an online photo album that includes a picture of the girl and her two sisters with Petraeus      “I was with Ganrl Patrais?’ the girl’s handwritten caption reads “He came to my haws.”      For Kelley to help post this if she were having an affair with the general would border on the pathological Bad enough that the news of Kelley’s involvement in setting the case in motion broke just in time for reporters to swarm the house during Caroline’s seventh birthday party there, complete with bouncy castle      Broadwell is herself married to a doctor and has two young children Maybe the parallels were part of what set her off Her father told the New York Daily News that there is “a lot more here than meets the eye,” though he declined say what that might be      Whatever transpired, the FBI agents found no indication that it constituted a crime or a threat to national security They confirmed this when they interviewed Broadwell and then Petraeus They are both said to have been forthcoming and consistent, even telling the agents more than they already knew      Petraeus seems to have been the first guy in memory not to lie about sex And a good thing too, because lying to a federal agent is a crime Martha Stewart found that out the hard way      By that point, FBI headquarters almost certainly had been notified One former agent with extensive experience estimates that it would have taken no more than 24 hours for word to get to Director Robert Mueller A case that might never have been if the agents in Tampa had heeded their initial misgivings now presented the head of the FBI with a predicament in which there were no happy options      In all electronic surveillance, including emails, the FBI is legally compelled to adhere to the principle of “minimization,” limiting the invasion of privacy as much as possible to what is specifically warranted This applies even when a case involves the worst kinds of criminals      Agents are required to abstain from even listening to such purely personal conversations as mushy talk between a mob killer and his mistress Minimization in these instances may have saved lives, as Mafia wives are notably more liable to express their fury physically than, say, military spouses The wife of one Gambino crime-family boss sent an email concerning her philandering husband that was unquestionably a death threat She then followed it with an apology      “I am sorry I misspelled ‘arsenic.’”      As the Tampa case did not involve a crime or a threat to national security, one might have expected the spirit of minimization to lead the FBI to keep any personal revelations within the bureau and not say anything to anybody      Perhaps Mueller was worried that if it leaked out somehow he might be accused of being like the FBI’s first director, J Edgar Hoover, who relished collecting dirt Hoover was not shy about using it to blackmail even the president Mueller might even have been accused to being party to a plot to muzzle Petraeus regarding the mess in Benghazi      Mueller chose to refer the matter to Petraeus’s titular superior, the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper The justification was that Petraeus was the head of an organization where such personal entanglements are considered a threat to security by making an agent a target for blackmail No Bond girls for our spies Mark it as an added twist that Skyfall opened in the midst of all this      The CIA double-no code aside, nobody could possibly believe that Petraeus would allow himself to be blackmailed into betraying the nation over an affair But the principle of the boss adhering to the rules remained And Clapper is said to have urged Petraeus to resign on his own terms rather than await the jackals      Petraeus dutifully went to the White House to tender his resignation Never mind that the Oval Office has witnessed much philandering over the decades with nobody having to resign Never mind that Bill Clinton remains living proof of the silliness of modern puritanism Our present president is by every indication a faithful husband, but he needed Clinton’s help to get reelected      The fact that the resignation came immediately after the election, even though the case is said to have begun back in late May or the beginning of June, has made more than a few people wonder about the timing      Whatever the truth in this regard, it remains pitifully ironic that Petraeus could come to such grief over a little sex under a desk in a war zone where thousands of people were and are earnestly seeking to blow other people to bloody bits Shoot but don’t schtup?      And just because Broadwell performed the literary equivalent of sex under a desk does not mean that any actual sex is anybody’s business      By the long-honored principle of minimization, the members of Congress who are demanding to know why they were not told earlier about Petraeus’s affair with his biographer should be asking another question      They should instead be demanding to know why anybody outside the FBI was told anything at all       ", "summary": "Those emails were said to contain \"stay away from my man\" type warnings, according to the AP, but a source tells the Daily Beast that's not so Yes, the emails included \"kind of cat-fight stuff,\" but they were \"more like, 'Who do you think you are? ..

Although De Beers has long resisted selling jewelry made with synthetic diamonds, it has been creating lab-made diamonds for industrial use for more than 50 years The company’s Element Six business, based in England, is the world’s largest supplier of lab-grown diamonds for drilling, mining and semiconductors      That expertise, the company says, allows it to undercut its competitors on the price of lab-grown diamonds (At the Diamond Foundry, a California-based company that counts actor Leonardo DiCaprio among its investors, for example, one-carat synthetic diamonds start at about $3,500 — more than four times what Lightbox plans to charge.)      “We want to be transparent but accessible,” said Coe of Lightbox “What we’re doing is giving consumers what they want: diamonds that are new and different, at an affordable price.”      Lightbox Jewelry will be available online in September, and executives say they plan to sell the line in stores by the end of the year The stones are created in the company’s labs in the United Kingdom, although De Beers is also investing $94 million in a new production facility near Portland, Ore., that is expected to open in 2020      Read more:      Walmart bought Bonobos — and the bros aren’t happy      Best Buy has figured out what its customers want: Personalized advice      What Starbucks could learn from this Washington restaurateur about race at work      Now hiring, for a one-day job: the gig economy hits retail ", "summary": "– De Beers' diamonds won't come exclusively from mines anymore That price point is essentially the point: While one of De Beers' genuine one carat diamonds costs about $8,000, Bloomberg reports similar lab-made ones currently run about $4,000 That means synthetics made by De Beers' rivals (among them Warren Buffett's Helzberg's Diamond Shops and Leonardo DiCaprio-funded Diamond Foundry) will be extremely expensive in comparison and the gulf between synthetic and real prices will widen, making the two categories more distinct You can make exactly the same one again and again.\" Lightbox's GM similarly painted the stones as low-brow in comments to the Washington Post: \"This is something you might buy for a best friend or for a Sweet 16.\" The diamonds will be available in white, pink, and blue and made in a facility in Portland, Ore., that De Beers plans to sink nearly $100 million into.", "summary_all": "– De Beers' diamonds won't come exclusively from mines anymore In a significant about-face, the company announced Tuesday it is getting into the synthetic diamond game with Lightbox, its new man-made diamond brand that will offer full carat stones from roughly $800 beginning in September That price point is essentially the point: While one of De Beers' genuine one carat diamonds costs about $8,000, Bloomberg reports similar lab-made ones currently run about $4,000 That means synthetics made by De Beers' rivals (among them Warren Buffett's Helzberg's Diamond Shops and Leonardo DiCaprio-funded Diamond Foundry) will be extremely expensive in comparison and the gulf between synthetic and real prices will widen, making the two categories more distinct CNN notes it's a big change for a company whose execs had pledged to never sell lab-grown stones; it even created a machine whose purpose is rooting out such fakes It justified the change by citing consumer demand, with CEO Bruce Cleaver calling Lightbox \"affordable fashion jewelry that may not be forever, but is perfect for right now.\" He called a spade a spade: \"Lab grown are not special, they're not real, they’re not unique You can make exactly the same one again and again.\" Lightbox's GM similarly painted the stones as low-brow in comments to the Washington Post: \"This is something you might buy for a best friend or for a Sweet 16.\" The diamonds will be available in white, pink, and blue and made in a facility in Portland, Ore., that De Beers plans to sink nearly $100 million into."}

lab-produced diamonds, Cleaver said De Beers is hoping to create big price gap with its new product, which will sell under the name Lightbox in the U.S A 1-carat man-made diamond sells for about $4,000 and a similar natural diamond fetches roughly $8,000 The lab diamonds from De Beers will sell for about $800 a carat      Lowest Cost      Still, De Beers says that its move isn’t to disrupt existing lab-diamond producers, but create a small, profitable business in its own right      “Given we are the lowest-cost producer, we can make a good business out of this,” Cleaver said “We have the tools, why wouldn’t we do this?”      De Beers is so adamant that the man-made diamonds are not competing with mined stones that it will not grade them in the traditional way That’s a stark contrast to current man-made sellers who offer ratings such as clarity and color, replicating terminology used for natural stones      “We’re not grading our lab-grown diamonds because we don’t think they deserve to be graded,” Cleaver said “They’re all the same.”      The pricing strategy will also be different De Beers plans to charge $200 for a quarter-carat, $400 for a half and $800 for a carat, another sharp break from natural stones that rise exponentially in price the bigger the diamond gets      Man-Made Gems      While De Beers has never sold man-made diamonds for jewelry before, it’s very good at making them The company’s Element Six unit is one of the world’s leading producers of synthetic diamonds, which are mostly used for industrial purposes It has also been producing gem-quality stones for years to help it tell the difference between natural and man-made types and to reassure consumers that they’re buying the real thing      Man-made gems currently make up a small part of the diamond market, but demand is increasing Global diamond production was about 142 million carats last year, according to analyst Paul Zimnisky That compares with lab production of less than 4.2 million carats, according to Bonas & Co      De Beers has been researching lab-made diamonds since the end of World War II and accelerated its work after a Swedish company synthesized the first diamond in 1953 The company has focused on lab diamonds for industrial uses, but also kept investing in technology for jewelry-grade gems      The shift to lab-diamond jewelry comes at a sensitive time for De Beers and its relationship with Botswana, the source of three-quarters of its diamonds The two have a sales agreement that lets the company market and sell gems from Botswana, giving De Beers its power over global prices The deal will soon be up for negotiation and Botswana is likely to push for more concessions      On Tuesday, De Beers said it had extensive talks with Botswana about the decision to sell man-made diamonds and the country supports the move ", "summary": "In a significant about-face, the company announced Tuesday it is getting into the synthetic diamond game

{"article_number": 105, "article_idx": 2, "article_text": " (CNN) Debris found in the western Indian Ocean on Wednesday appears to be part of a Boeing 777, the same model as Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that disappeared in 2014, according to a source close to the investigation      The source said there is a unique element to the Boeing 777's flaperon, a wing component, that Boeing observers believe they are seeing in photos      The debris was found Wednesday off the coast of Reunion Island, a French department in the western Indian Ocean It is being examined to determine whether it is connected to flight MH370 , a member of the French air force in Reunion said Wednesday      The debris was found off the coast of St Andre, a community on the island, according to Adjutant Christian Retournat      Boeing officials conducted an initial assessment of the debris using photographs The source stressed the observations are preliminary      Police carry a piece of debris from an unidentified aircraft found off the coast of Reunion island      K.S Narendran, whose wife was on the plane, said he was reticent to call the discovery a major development      I think this is very early days yet All we know is that a small part has been found It is still a little early to suggest it does belong to MH370, he told CNN's Erin Burnett OutFront from India I think it is premature to feel that it is all coming to a close or that we are even closer to the truth      Sarah Bajc, whose partner, Philip Wood, was on MH370, said her heart has been in my throat for most of the day      During the initial days of the search for the plane, there were several reports of possible debris sightings in the waters closer to where authorities believe the plane went down, but none of those was actual wreckage Bajc said as an emotional safety mechanism she disbelieves any reports like Wednesday's discovery      She wants verification, she told Anderson Cooper 360˚      If ultimately this is the piece of the wing, then that little thread of hope that I have been holding on to will, will have to break And reality will have to take over, she said holding back tears But, yeah, up until now, I and most of the family members have continued to believe that until we have a body .. we can't give up hoping they will still come back      If this turns out to be a piece of MH370, it would be the first piece of physical evidence that the plane crashed      Malaysian team en route      Earlier, Retournat said the debris appeared to be a wing flap and had been taken to the island, about 380 nautical miles off the coast of Madagascar      The Malaysian government has dispatched a team to Reunion Island to investigate the debris, Malaysian Minister of Transportation Liow Tiong Lai said in New York      We need to verify We have wreckage found that needs to be further verified before we can further confirm if it belongs to MH370 So we have dispatched a team to investigate on these issues and we hope that we can identify it as soon as possible, the minister said      Malaysia Airlines said it was working with authorities to determine where the part came from      At the moment, it would be too premature for the airline to speculate on the origin of the flaperon, the carrier said      CNN analysts said there are indications the airplane part could be from a Boeing 777, and if that's the case, it's likely from MH370      Making the determination should be very simple because the serial numbers riveted to numerous parts of the plane can be linked to not only the plane's model, but also the exact aircraft, said CNN aviation analyst Les Abend, who flew 777s during his 30 years as a pilot      This means crash investigators may be able to figure it out from photographs of the part, which could be an aileron, a flap or a flaperon, even before arriving on the island, he said      Several clues      Airplane debris is being examined to see if it's connected to MH370      There are at least three elements of the discovery that are consistent with MH370, said CNN safety analyst David Soucie The first is that the part appears to have been torn off the aircraft      This is from a sudden impact, it looks like to me, Soucie said      There also is a seal on the top of the part that is consistent with what I would see on an inside flap on a triple 7, he said, and the barnacles on the part are consistent with the parasitic activity that would take place from being underwater so long      However, the part appears to be coated in white paint, which would run counter to Soucie's other observations in that the 777's parts would be coated in zinc chromate, not paint Soucie acknowledged, however, that the part could be coated in something from the ocean      If it is a part from a triple 7, we can be fairly confident it is from 370 because there just haven't been that many triple 7 crashes and there haven't been any in this area, said CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo      Antoine Forestier, a journalist on the island where the debris was found, said people who were on shore gardening saw the plane part drifting in the ocean      Reporters from Antenne Reunion looked at the debris, which Forestier said was about 2 meters by 1 meter (6.5 feet by 3 feet)      There was a marking BB670 on the part      Soucie said he believes the number is a part number, though it might be from a subcontractor      Drift possibilities      The head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the agency tasked by Malaysia with leading the search for MH370, said the piece of debris is not inconsistent with drift modeling done by Australian authorities      If there was something from MH370 it could have reached Reunion Island from the area we're covering, said ATSB Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan It's not inconsistent with the drift modeling we've done It's not inconsistent with the search area we're covering      Dolan would not say how likely it was that any debris would move in a westerly direction      There's a range of possibilities, he said It's not an exact science Dolan said surface currents, wind direction and how high an object was floating in the water might all play a role      Photos: The search for MH370 Two years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing, a relative of one of the passengers burns incense in Beijing on

radioactive waste water into the sea At the same time they are resorting to desperate measures to contain the damage, such as using bath salts to try to locate the source of leaks at the crippled complex 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo      Three weeks after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and massive tsunami hit northeast Japan, sending some of Daiichi's reactors into partial meltdown, engineers are no closer to regaining control of the power plant or stopping radioactive leaks      The quake and tsunami left nearly 28,000 people dead or missing and Japan's northeast coast a wreck      The world's costliest natural disaster has caused power blackouts and cuts to supply chains and business hours It is threatening economic growth and the yen, while a recent opinion poll suggested voters want embattled Prime Minister Naoto Kan to form a coalition in order to steer Japan through its worst crisis since World War Two      Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) was forced on Monday to release low-level radioactive seawater that had been used to cool overheated fuel rods after it ran out of storage capacity for more highly contaminated water      A TEPCO official was in tears as he told a news conference: We are very sorry for this region and those involved      The water, which is being released to free storage capacity for more highly contaminated water, is about 100 times more radioactive than legal limits Koichi Nakamura, a deputy director-general of Japan's Nuclear Industrial Safety Agency (NISA), told a news conference in Vienna about 11,500 metric tons of water would have to be discharged      He also said Japan had not ruled out expanding the 20-km evacuation zone around the site      Engineers planned to build two giant silt curtains made of polyester fabric in the sea to hinder the spread of more contamination from the plant      Japan has also asked Russia for the Suzuran, a ship which treats radioactive liquids, Kyodo and Jiji news agencies said      The ship, a joint venture between Japan and Russia, was designed to help decommission nuclear submarines in Russia's Pacific fleet in Vladivostock, ensuring radioactive waste was not dumped into the Sea of Japan, Kyodo said      It could take months to stem the leaks and longer to regain control of the power station, damaged by the March quake and tsunami, though a U.S official in Vienna said there was no evidence the spent fuel in the reactors was restarting a nuclear reaction after being shut down      DISASTER MAY SEE YEN WEAKEN      Japan, the world's third largest economy but also one of its most indebted nations, has estimated the damages bill may top $300 billion      The damage from the nuclear crisis and the subsequent power shortage will last for several years, said Eiji Hirano, former assistant governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ)      There's a strong chance Japan's economy will contract in the current fiscal year, he told Reuters in an interview      A former senior finance ministry official, Eisuke Sakakibara, said the yen would weaken in the coming months, possibly beyond 90 to the dollar, underlining expectations a near four-year rally in the currency may be over      The yen traded at 84.05 per dollar early on Tuesday      The disaster initially saw the yen soar on speculation Japanese would repatriate funds for reconstruction, prompting the G7 intervention to knock it back      This atomic power issue is an incident which would result in depreciation of the exchange rate, Sakakibara told reporters in Tokyo      Unpopular and under pressure to quit or call a snap poll before the disaster, Prime Minister Kan has been criticised for his management of the disaster      One newspaper poll said nearly two-thirds of voters wanted the government to form a coalition with the major opposition party and work together to recover from the disaster      BATH SALTS, SEA CURTAIN      In their desperation to stop radioactive leaks, TEPCO engineers have used anything at hand They have mixed sawdust and newspapers with polymers and cement in an unsuccessful attempt to seal a crack in a concrete pit at reactor No.2      On Monday, they resorted to powdered bath salts to produce a milky color in water to help trace the source of the leak      TEPCO said it was also planning to drape a curtain into the sea off the nuclear plant to try to prevent radioactive silt drifting out into the ocean      The exact source of the radiation leaks remains unknown NISA is investigating a damaged embankment near a sluice gate at the No.2 reactor and the possibility it may be seeping through a layer of small stones below a concrete pipe      TEPCO said it would build tanks to hold contaminated seawater, was towing a floating tank which will arrive next week, and was negotiating the purchase of three more      If the current situation continues for a long time, accumulating more radioactive substances, it will have a huge impact on the ocean, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said      Small levels of radiation from the plant have been detected as far away as Europe and the United States and several countries have banned milk and produce from the vicinity      Singapore extended a ban on Japanese food imports on Monday after detecting radiation in more fruit and vegetable imports Kan asked the European Union on Monday for a calm response to Japanese imports The EU has urged radiation testing of Japanese food and feed imports      (Additional reporting by Yoko

Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Experts estimate that about seven tons an hour of radioactive water is escaping the pit Safety officials have said that the water, which appears to be coming from the damaged No 2 reactor, contains one million becquerels per liter of iodine 131, or about 10,000 times the levels normally found in water at a nuclear plant      “There is still a steady stream of water from the pit,” Mr Nishiyama said, but workers would continue to “observe and evaluate” the situation overnight      The leak underscores the dangerous side effects of the strategy to cool the plant’s reactors and spent fuel storage pools by pumping them with hundreds of tons of water While much of that water evaporates, a significant portion also turns into dangerous runoff that has been discovered in various parts of the plant, endangering workers at the plant and hindering repair efforts On March 24, three workers were injured when they stepped into a pool of radioactive water in one of the plant’s turbine buildings      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      In recent days, workers have tried to clear the contaminated pools, but have struggled

reactors at the moment, since the normal cooling systems at the plant are inoperable and more radioactive material would be released if the reactors were allowed to melt down fully or if the rods caught fire      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Still, some experts expressed bewilderment at what they called an 11th-hour bid to plug the leak      “I’ve never heard of anything like it at a nuclear power plant,” said Itsuro Kimura, emeritus professor at Kyoto University and director of the Japan-based Institute of Nuclear Technology What is really needed, he said, is for the cooling systems to come back online at the plant’s six reactors Those cooling systems work by circulating water around the nuclear fuel, producing little runoff      Photo      “That is the best way to stop the leakage of radioactive water,” Mr Kimura said “But for now, they have to stop the water leaking the best they can.”      Tokyo Electric has come under growing scrutiny for its handling of the nuclear crisis set off by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan In recent days, reports surfaced that the company would be taken over by the government Tokyo Electric reported that a

bipartisan debt-reduction deal, The Washington Post’s Lori Montgomery reports Jonathan Ernst/Reuters      With the election behind them, Obama and lawmakers have turned their attention to the fiscal cliff Here’s a look at some of the leaders who will influence whether the country can avoid falling off the cliff      Negotiations to avert the year-end “fiscal cliff” advanced at a glacial pace Wednesday Here’s a look at some of the leaders in the fiscal-cliff debate      Negotiations to avert the year-end “fiscal cliff” advanced at a glacial pace Wednesday Here’s a look at some of the leaders in the fiscal-cliff debate      President Obama offered Republicans a detailed plan Thursday for averting the year-end “fiscal cliff” that calls for $1.6 trillion in new taxes, $50 billion in fresh spending on the economy and an effective end to congressional control over the size of the national debt      The proposal, delivered to the Capitol by Treasury Secretary Timothy F Geithner, mirrors previous White House deficit-reduction plans and satisfies Democrats’ demands that negotiations begin on terms dictated by the newly-reelected president      The offer lacks any concessions to Republicans, most notably on the core issue of where to set tax rates for the wealthiest Americans After two weeks of talks between the White House and aides to House Speaker John A Boehner (R-Ohio), it seemed to take Republicans by surprise      Boehner quickly rejected the proposal and was trying late Thursday to decide how to respond, aides said After meeting with Geithner for about 45 minutes Thursday morning, the speaker announced his frustration with a negotiation process in which nearly three weeks have lapsed since the election with “no substantive progress.”      “I’m disappointed in where we are, and disappointed in what’s happened over the last couple weeks,” Boehner told reporters “Going over the fiscal cliff is serious business And I’m here seriously trying to resolve it And I would hope the White House would get serious as well.”      Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called the proposal a “step backward” from compromise — with time running out for policymakers to agree on a plan to prevent more than $500 billion in tax increases and spending cuts that could rattle the economy      “This is a real problem Every day, the delay brings us one step closer to the fiscal cliff that we simply must avoid,” McConnell said      Democratic leaders, meanwhile, were triumphant after receiving similar briefings from Geithner and White House legislative liaison Rob Nabors Top Democrats have for months insisted that an Obama victory would entitle them to demand far more in new taxes than Republicans have been willing to consider, to seek new measures to boost economic growth, and to avoid major cuts to entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare      “Democrats are on the same page,” said Senate Majority Leader Harry M Reid (D-Nev.) “The president has made his proposal; we need a proposal from them.”      Although the White House offer seemed to startle Republicans, it contains little that would be unfamiliar to anyone following the president’s recent public statements The exception was his proposal on the federal debt limit GOP aides said Obama is seeking to permanently enact procedures that were temporarily adopted in the summer of 2011 that allow the White House to unilaterally increase the debt ceiling unless two-thirds of lawmakers disapprove      That process, initially proposed by McConnell, was not intended to become permanent By trying to make it so, Obama is seeking to avoid another damaging battle over the debt ceiling that would again risk a national default However, this change would also deprive Congress of its historic authority over federal borrowing      Unless Congress acts on the fiscal cliff, taxes will rise significantly in January for nearly 90 percent of Americans, and about $65 billion will be sliced out of the Pentagon and other agency budgets, probably triggering a recession Simply canceling the changes, however, risks undermining confidence in the nation’s ability to manage its rising debt      View Graphic What going over the 'fiscal cliff' would mean         Financial markets, which in recent weeks have been optimistic about the prospects of a deal to replace the cliff with a less traumatic deficit-reduction plan, were whipsawed by Thursday’s declarations The Dow Jones Industrial Average took a nose-dive during Boehner’s 11:30 a.m news conference, dropping nearly 60 points in eight minutes It closed up nearly 37 points, or 0.3 percent      Obama’s offer comes nearly two weeks after Boehner and other congressional leaders opened talks at the White House Since then, administration officials have negotiated directly with Boehner’s staff Senior Republican aides said relations deteriorated in recent days, prompting Boehner to call the White House on Wednesday evening to request to speak with the president      Boehner’s aides declined to comment on the 28-minute call, but Republicans in the Capitol said Obama dominated the conversation and was forceful in demanding that Boehner pass legislation to maintain tax rates for the middle class and let them rise on income over $250,000 a year      Boehner called the discussion “frank and direct” and said he remains “hopeful that productive conversations can be had in the days ahead.” But both sides confirmed that no additional meetings have been planned but emphasized that talks will continue      Obama’s proposal, as outlined by Republicans, would purportedly trim the debt by about $4 trillion over the next decade, in part through spending cuts already in force and savings from ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan Also included are $1.6 trillion in taxes and about $400 billion in savings from changes to federal health and entitlement programs      With regard to taxes, the White House wants about $1 trillion in new revenue from the year-end expiration of the George W Bush-era tax cuts on income over $250,000 Obama also is demanding that dividends be taxed as normal income and that the estate tax be raised to 45 percent and expanded to cover estates worth as little as $3.5 million — policies for which the Democratic Senate was unable to win approval earlier this year      The rest of the tax increases and the entitlement savings would come next year, through congressional revisions to the tax code and retirement programs      The White House proposal would delay automatic cuts at federal agencies for one year while funding other Democratic priorities, including $50 billion for a new infrastructure bank and additional benefits for unemployed workers      The plan also calls for extending the payroll tax cut, or adopting a similar tax break for working families, in addition to extending income tax cuts for the vast majority of taxpayers      “Right now, the only thing preventing us from reaching a deal that averts the fiscal cliff and avoids a tax hike on 98 percent of Americans is the refusal of congressional Republicans to ask the very wealthiest individuals to pay higher tax rates,” White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage said “We remain willing to do tough things to compromise, and it’s time for Republicans in Washington to join the chorus of other voices    who support a balanced approach that asks more from the wealthiest Americans.” ", "summary": "– Details are emerging on Treasury secretary Tim Geithner's trek to Capitol Hill today to

not approve He also wants the estate tax to be levied at 45 percent on inheritances over $3.5 million, a step several Democratic senators balked at The Senate bill made no changes to the estate tax,

proposed maintaining war spending over the next decade at the current rate      “Listen, this is not a game,” Mr Boehner said “Jobs are on the line The American economy is on the line And this is a
