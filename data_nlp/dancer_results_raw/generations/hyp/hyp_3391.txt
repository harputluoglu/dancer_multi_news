â€“ A 67-year-old grandmother is in critical condition after drinking sweet tea laced with a highly toxic industrial cleaning solution, the AP reports "It's disturbing that this kind of toxic, poisonous material would be in the food-prep area and somehow find its way into the iced tea vat," says the woman's lawyer "I don't know how something like that can happen." Police are still investigating how the chemical ended up in the sweet-tea container, but they think it was accidental "It appears she was the first to drink the tea that day, and restaurant employees dumped it out after she was burned," says
