– A woman who says her ex-husband sexually assaulted her while they were in a three-year relationship says she's "devastated" by the allegations, but says she doesn't want to "be with someone who was unfaithful." "I was heartbroken to read Samantha's post," he said in a statement, per Variety "My three year relationship was not perfect—we were ultimately not a good match and argued—even shouted at each other—but I loved her, and did my best to uplift and support her as a partner and companion in any way and at no time did I sexually assault her," he said
