â€“ New York State's attorney general has resigned after four women accused him of physically abusing them and threatening to kill them if they broke up with him, the New York Times reports In a statement, the 63-year-old said the allegations "are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office's work at this critical time," per the Times "I therefore resign my office, effective at the close of business on May 8, 2018."
