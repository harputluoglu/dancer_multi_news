â€“ A Texas man went a bit too far in his quest for the perfect marriage proposal: Joshua Mason, 27, and Katie Davis, 28, ended up in "a serious situation" and having to be rescued by authorities The couple flew from Texas to Denver Friday and set out on a hike the next day near Nederland, Colo., the Boulder Daily Camera reports "Mason was hoping to find an isolated scenic location 'away from any other people' to propose," says the Boulder County Sheriff's Office They hiked more than 8 miles to the nearly 13,000-foot-high summit of Jasper Peak on the Continental Divide, and Davis said yes to the proposal .. but then it started getting dark, the trail wasn't clearly marked, and the newly engaged couple ran into big trouble, a Boulder County Sheriff Mountain Deputy tells Fox 31 They weren't wearing warm clothes, didn't have enough water, and hadn't gotten acclimated to the altitude They got disoriented and were lost for hours, ultimately ending up on a cliff and unable to go any further; around midnight, a camper in the area heard them screaming One of the campers hiked down to her vehicle so she could drive somewhere to call 911, and rescue crews arrived to the couple's location by 4:30am They were back at the trailhead by 6:30am Sunday and did not require further medical assistance "Last thing I said [to the couple was], 'So is the engagement still on?'" the deputy says "And she said, 'Oh yes.'"
