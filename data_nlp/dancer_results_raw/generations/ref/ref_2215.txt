The research, published in Lancet Public Health, looked at 1.1 million French hospital patients diagnosed with dementia from 2008 to 2013 Of those patients, 16.5% of the men and 4% of the women had alcohol use disorders, which CNN reports is about twice the rate of those without dementia The stats for early-onset dementia were worse The bottom line? "Alcohol use disorders were a major risk factor for onset of all types of dementia, and especially early-onset dementia" per the study Study author Michael Schwarzinger says that while the rate of alcohol use disorders is lower in the US than in France, "it remains substantial enough to be considered [a] major risk factor for dementia onset."
