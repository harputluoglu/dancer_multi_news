– A dad who created a blog called "The Psycho Ex-Wife" to document his bitter divorce and custody battle is balking at a court order to take down the site or risk losing joint custody of his two sons Anthony Morelli—whose descriptions of his ex-wife on the blog include "Jabba The Hutt, with less personality"—says the judge's order is a clear violation of his First Amendment rights, reports the New York Daily News Morelli says the blog has become a forum where people experiencing similar issues can share their experiences The judge, however, decided that Morelli had gone beyond venting to "outright cruelty" that was likely to have a negative effect on the couple's sons, ages 10 and 12 "This is about children,” she said “You may say anything that you would like to say You may publish it You may put it on a billboard But you will not have your children, because that is abusive."
