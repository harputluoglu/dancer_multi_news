– Al-Qaeda's spiritual leaders say the organization is on the verge of "collapse" while ISIS thrives The former al-Qaeda branch—booted last year for disobeying Osama bin Laden successor Ayman al-Zawahiri—is attracting money and recruits that have helped it spread from Afghanistan to west Africa, even as an al-Qaeda group in Pakistan sold its laptops and cars to pay for food and rent last year, a former member tells the Guardian Zawahiri "operates solely based on the allegiance There is no organizational structure," says jihadi scholar Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi The Guardian reports al-Qaeda's downfall began with Zawahiri's ascension after bin Laden's death Zawahiri was forced to hide out near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border while fighters that would eventually form ISIS came together in Syria and Iraq "What is leadership," asks an al-Qaeda associate, "if your leader is in Afghanistan and your soldiers are in Iraq?" Insiders say ISIS, which won't accept another jihadi group in its territory, is winning the propaganda war as well as the war on the ground
