â€“ A teen apparently saw it as the perfect "promposal." The National Park Service sees it as vandalism In theory, the vandalism carries a punishment of up to six months in prison and a $500 fine, but monument officials say they would be lenient if a young person comes forward "What better way to impress your date than to show that you're the type of person who will take responsibility for their actions?" says monument rep Frank Hayde, per CNN The park service is working on removing the graffiti, but it first must assess whether the paint damaged any cultural items of note, such as works of art that might have been on the rocks.
