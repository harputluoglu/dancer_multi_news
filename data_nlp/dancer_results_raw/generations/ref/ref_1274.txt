â€“ A heroically loyal Washington state dog pulled a Lassie this week, bringing help to an equally adorable pooch stuck at the bottom of a cistern, KING 5 reports Tillie and Phoebe had been missing for a week Monday when a resident alerted volunteers from the Vashon Island Pet Protectors that a strange dog had been repeatedly approaching them, then heading back into a wooded ravine nearby Volunteers searched the ravine, which was miles away from where the dogs had last been seen, and finally heard a single bark when they called out Tillie's name They found Tillie lying next to an old cistern inside of which Phoebe was perched on a small pile of concrete to stay dry "For nearly a week, Tillie stayed by her side with the exception of the few minutes of each day when she went for help," states a post on the Pet Protectors Facebook page Pet Protectors describes Tillie's devotion to Phoebe as "a humbling example of the power of love." Good dog.
