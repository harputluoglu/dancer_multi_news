â€“ Archaeologists have uncovered another parking lot find, only this time it's in Scotland, and what they discovered is best described as a "Thing." Yep, that's the technical term for a Viking parliamentary gathering site, one of which has been unearthed in the town of Dingwall That name had long clued archaeologists into the potential for such a find: Dingwall is likely derived from the word thingvellir, or "the field of the assembly," LiveScience reports But finding a "Thing" site is no small task, in part because the gatherings usually occurred in open fields, and the temporary nature of them meant only modest traces of human life were left behind It was uncovered after the team used historical records to identify a mound that had once been called the "assembly mound"; a parking lot now covers it One guess: Thorfinn the Mighty, who fought a battle in the area around that time
