â€“ A 73-year-old man is banned from a Florida beach after a parent complained that he was handing out business cards that read, "Sugardaddy seeking his sugarbaby." While police didn't arrest Richard Basaraba, Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue Capt Tammy Marris says he's been told to stay off the beach and walkovers for six months for violating an ordinance that prohibits soliciting on the beach, the AP reports The ban is a trespass order, and Marris says someone who violates such an order can be arrested for trespassing Basaraba wasn't arrested because police didn't see him handing out the business cards Basaraba told the Daytona Beach News-Journal he's "devastated" by what he considers an overreaction by officials He said he wasn't trying to entice anyone into doing anything illegal when he handed a business card out to a group of girls on Daytona Beach on Saturday But the mother of a 16-year-old girl complained to authorities after her daughter told her about the incident The girl told officials the man handed her 18-year-old friend the business card while they were at the beach It featured a picture of a younger woman sitting on the lap of an older man wearing a business suit Printed on the card were an email address and the accompanying text: "Ask me about your monthly allowance." Basaraba told the newspaper he's been careful not to hand the cards, which he recently ordered, to anyone under 18 A beach patrol report says Basaraba told the 16-year-old that she should contact him when she's 18 "I engaged [the younger girl] before I knew she was 16 because of her bust size," Basaraba tells the News-Journal "I did make the mistake of saying, 'You're the cutest one here Call me when you're 18.'"
