– A “mommy blogger” made quite an Internet stir with a recent post defending her 5-year-old son’s decision to cross-dress on Halloween She recounts how, when he showed up at his church pre-school dressed as Daphne from Scooby Doo, a group of mothers immediately “went wide-eyed and made faces as if they smelled decomp,” then made sure to air their “concerns” to her “Secondly, if my son is gay, OK I will love him no less Thirdly, I am not worried that your son will grow up to be an actual ninja so back off.” She’s gotten quite a bit of support, but the post also spurred controversy—partially because she titled it “My Son Is Gay,” even though “the post really isn’t about gayness per se,” writes Richard Lawson on Gawker “Her critics say that she's too early, and maybe too giddily, assigning labels that really don't have any weight when your child is so young.” Click here to read a similar essay by a dad.
