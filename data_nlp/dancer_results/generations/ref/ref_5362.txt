The bones were found, buried in a coffin, under an old roadbed in Jamestown in 1996, WTKR reports Researchers knew the skeletal remains belonged to a 19-year-old man who may have been from Europe, who had probably been living in Jamestown for a few years, and who likely had the status of a gentleman (because of the coffin) His right leg bones were twisted and broken below the knee, and a lead musket ball and lead shot were found there; researchers determined that's what killed him (The ammunition would have ruptured a major artery, NPR explains.) Now, the Jamestown Rediscovery Project says, new research has uncovered a 1624 duel between George Harrison and Richard Stephens "This wound shows that the person was killed by getting hit in the side of the knee So in a duel, you stand sideways and this would come through like that," says a director for the project However, one mystery still remains: “That’s a combat round It’s almost like a shotgun but it also has a main bullet So you wouldn’t think unless somebody was cheating in the duel that they would have that kind of a load." It's not the only recent nefarious discovery at Jamestown—scientists found evidence of cannibalism, as well.
