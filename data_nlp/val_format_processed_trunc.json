successes in coming days Trump and his aides hope to take a victory lap over his first overseas trip \u2014 a sweeping nine-day excursion through five different countries across the Middle East and Europe      In Saudi Arabia, the president's first stop abroad, Trump secured a massive arms sale, worth about $110 billion      Here are five takeaways from the president's tumultuous trip      Trump took a softer tone on Islam      This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects or different civilizations, Trump said This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life and decent people, all in the name of religion, people that want to protect life and want to protect their religion This is a battle between good and evil      The president arrived in Israel amid revelations that he had divulged highly classified intelligence provided by the key ally to Russian officials But Trump quickly managed to ease the controversy and reaffirm U.S support for Israel Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raved on Twitter about Trump's taking such a strong stand for Israel and the Jewish people      Trump paid a solemn visit to the Western Wall in East Jerusalem, where he stayed for a moment of silence before placing a note between the wall's stones It was the first trip to the wall by a sitting president, though other presidents have visited the holy site either before or after leaving the White House      But he also expressed the hope of making peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and never declared his intention to move the U.S embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem \u2014 a move that would be certain to anger Palestinians, please Israel and complicate peacemaking      I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s one of the toughest deals in the world,\u201d he said, referring to Middle East peacemaking But I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to get there eventually      Trump's America first approach to foreign policy was on full display in Brussels when the president addressed a gathering of fellow NATO members at the organization's headquarters in Belgium      At the heart of his speech was his assertion that the U.S is shouldering an unfair burden of NATO's defense costs, and that member countries must spend at least two percent of their GDP on defense, a target that all members agreed on in 2014 Currently, only five NATO countries meet that spending target      Nevertheless, in his address to NATO leaders, Trump refused to reaffirm U.S support for the organization's principle of mutual defense, and failed to address growing European concern over Russia's intentions in the region      Trump refused to join Group of Seven (G7) leaders on Saturday in taking a pledge to support the Paris climate deal, leaving it unclear as to whether the U.S will remain part of the agreement      If the U.S withdraws, as Trump has floated in the past, it would be the first to do so among the 195 countries that have agreed to the deal Trump's decision not to take the pledge further highlighted a stark division between the U.S and its allies on the issue of climate change      But as a presidential candidate, Trump campaigned on bolstering American fossil fuels, particularly the coal industry      Trump never held a press conference      Trump broke from tradition in never fielding reporters' questions in a news conference during the trip, which is unlike his predecessors In the week leading up to his departure on the trip, the White House faced a series of controversies that began with the president's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey earlier in the month      Those scandals continued to mount throughout his trip, and White House officials have remained largely silent on them, although aides took a few questions in media gaggles and conference calls In a press conference on Saturday, national security adviser H.R McMaster and Cohn declined to answer questions about the growing controversy surrounding Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner      The president, since he left [Washington] has been dealing with foreign leaders, he's been dealing with jobs, he's been dealing with economic growth, he's been dealing with diplomacy, he's been dealing with unfair trade, he's been dealing with Paris, he's been dealing with China, Cohn said      His agenda has been overflowing He's been fully consumed with what's going on here      Senior White House officials on Saturday continued to remain quiet in response to revelations that Kushner discussed with Russia's ambassador establishing a backchannel line of communication between the Trump transition team and Moscow      With daily press briefings expected to resume, the White House will likely face questions

(Associated Press)      TAORMINA, Sicily (AP) \u2014 As he dashed through the Middle East and Europe, Donald Trump looked like a conventional American leader abroad He solemnly laid a wreath at a Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, had an audience with the pope at the Vatican and stood center stage with Western allies at the annual summits that dominate the diplomatic calendar      But when Trump spoke, he sounded like anything but a typical U.S president      To the White House, Trump's first trip abroad was an embodiment of the promises he made as a candidate to put America's interests first and break through the guardrails that have long defined U.S foreign policy Trump advisers repeatedly described the trip as historic and groundbreaking, including one senior official who brashly said without evidence that Trump had united the entire Muslim world      Addressing U.S troops Saturday at a Sicilian air base moments before departing for Washington, Trump himself declared: I think we hit a home run      Yet those questions are sure to persist, particularly given Trump's remarkable lashing of NATO allies in Brussels Standing alongside his counterparts, the president effectively accused countries who do not meet NATO's goal of spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product of sponging off American taxpayers He left some allies, already nervous about Russia's saber-rattling and Trump's public affection for Russian President Vladimir Putin, further flummoxed when he ended his remarks without making an explicit statement of support for Article 5, the common defense clause that underpins the 68-year-old military alliance      The mood of Article 5, the idea that we are all in this together, is not the mood he conveyed, said Jon Alterman, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington The mood he conveyed is you guys are a bunch of freeloaders      While Trump emerged from the summit without a final decision on the Paris pact, he declared in a tweet Saturday that he will make a final decision next week      Trump's nine-day, five-stop international tour resulted in few tangible policy achievements The U.S inked a $110 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia and unveiled numerous business commitments in the region, though the White House never provided specific details about the scope of the agreements At NATO, the White House touted the alliance's commitment to boosting defense spending, though the resolution was essentially a continuation of a pact agreed to two years earlier      From the start, he set a new direction Instead of following presidential tradition by making his international debut in a neighboring democracy like Canada or Mexico, Trump flew to Saudi Arabia, the repressive desert kingdom      Trump betrayed no awkwardness at relishing the warm embrace of one of the world's most oppressive governments Instead, he reciprocated with a pledge to not publicly chastise the ruling royal family for its crackdown on political dissent      Trump was lavishly feted in Israel as well, embraced by a prime minister who despised his predecessor and was eager to flatter the new president Trump received multiple standing ovations \u2014 one of his favorite measures of success \u2014 during a speech on U.S relations with Israel The photo of his solemn visit to the Western Wall was splashed across the front pages of Israel's newspapers      Like many of his predecessors, Trump made a personal appeal for peace between Israelis and Palestinians But he never uttered the words two-state solution, the longtime U.S policy plan that would create a separate homeland for Palestinians He also made no mention of new Jewish settlements in the West Bank, a major point of contention for the Palestinians      The smaller moments of the president's trip were endlessly dissected as well, from first lady Melania Trump's apparent reluctance to hold her husband's hand on occasion to his shoving aside of Montenegro's prime minister to get to the front of a pack of leaders at a NATO photo opportunity At the G-7, it was Trump's interactions with other leaders that commanded attention      Instead, he got in a golf cart and the American president's mini-motorcade drove the route alone, Trump once more having charted his own course", "summary": "A look

reprise the foreign agenda he'd spend the last nine days considering      We have been gone for a long time, Trump declared at the Sigonella Air Base here Everywhere I go -- we have been gone close to nine days, this will be nine days -- I think we hit a home run no matter where we are      Trump's first voyage abroad was a story told in chapters, each successively less pleasant for a President still taking stock of his standing on the world stage      In some ways, uncertainty amounted to a win, at least in the minds of Trump's aides As Trump prepared to depart Washington last Friday, there was little surety among his staff that the nine-day odyssey could proceed without failure Trump himself, who hadn't slept in a bed that wasn't his own since taking office, remained skeptical a five-country itinerary could end well      But by then it was too late With meetings locked in and the world anticipating his global debut, Trump settled into his quarters on Air Force One for a flight four times longer than any he'd taken as President      A king's welcome      Any concern about an uneasy touch-down abroad disappeared quickly Welcomed with horse parades, draped with a gold medal and lured into a male-only sword dance , Trump had finally found a country to treat him like a king, if only for a weekend      Yet an air of na\u00efvet\u00e9 hung in the air after the President's speech to leaders of more than 50 Muslim majority nations The White House described it as something of a fait accompli, with a top official twice declaring that the President had united the Muslim world      In truth, Trump had done nothing of the sort, even with his well-received Riyadh address Trump's policy adviser Stephen Miller -- whose role writing the speech raised eyebrows -- had drafted a conciliatory address that replaced Trump's radical Islamic terror watchword with the milder Islamist extremism      As Trump delivered his opening argument to a room packed with leaders of Muslim nations, however, the newly sedate language didn't entirely come through      Trump was unsatisfied with the language his advisers had prepared for a speech later that morning The condemnation of the attack lacked verve, Trump believed Describing the attackers in ordinary terms wouldn't suffice Instead he wrote up his own description, using the insult he's long considered the most cutting      I will call them from now on losers because that's what's they are They're losers, Trump said a few hours later standing alongside Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas We'll have more of them But they're losers -- just remember that      I hope this heralds a real change, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ahead of Trump's remarks at the Israel Museum Because if the attacker had been Palestinian and the victims had been Israeli children, the suicide bomber's family would have received a stipend from the Palestinian Authority That's Palestinian law That law must be changed      When the President arrived at the Vatican on a sun-splashed morning on Wednesday, Pope Francis didn't lecture Trump He gently encouraged him to do something else: Read      A skilled politician in his own right, Francis honed in on the President's pending decision whether to pull the US from the Paris climate accord It was the first of several conversations Trump conducted this week on the landmark carbon reduction agreement, which he vowed as a candidate to scrap      I'll be reading them, Trump said of the essays from the Pope on the environment and creating peace      He's the second American president to visit the Vatican under Francis' papacy While President Barack Obama's meeting was 20 minutes longer than Trump's, the Holy See wasted little time comparing the two      As he left the Apostolic Palace, Trump told the Pope: I won't forget what you said      Flying north from Rome, Trump found the temperature quickly cooling He arrived at NATO's headquarters

{"article_number": 2936, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": "When Kendall Jenner announced she was going to star in a Pepsi ad, some thought she would take the Cindy Crawford route, starring as a hot and bothered model who quenches her thirst with an icy soda But this political climate calls for something deeper, and Jenner's ad is an attempt      In her clip, she forgoes her modeling duties to join a protest outside her studio and share a Pepsi with the policeman at the demonstration, in an effort to demonstrate unity The model finds herself among a diverse crowd, along with two supporting characters\u2014a hijabi photographer and a male cellist\u2014in the three-minute-long commercial Some viewers have already pointed out the ad is questionable, and called out Pepsi for co-opting protests (which we've seen in recent months to fight big, real problems like gender inequality, Islamophobia and systematic racism) for the sake of selling soda      This commercial is just a jumping-off point for 20-year-old Marley (And yes, if you couldn't tell by his last name, he's Bob Marley's grandson.) He released Lions in February this year, has already collaborated with Katy Perry and plans to release an EP this summer Before the ad premiered, Marley talked to HarpersBAZAAR.com about writing the song and being inspired by his grandfather's legacy      He's glad Pepsi chose his song for this commercial      It's such a good way of spreading a message, a gathering of unity So the music really goes hand in hand with the message of unity in this commercial I was happy that I could be a part of the new movement I was excited      The 'Lions' inspiration was unity I started with a riff on the guitar, and I was playing the riff in the studio I knew the drums and then the song really fell in hand in hand We knew it had a power, a message, so it was really natural      We've always needed it, but right now we need it more than ever Well, it's a constant need of unity and togetherness So I just added onto that I'm happy that this generation grabbed onto it      The ad focuses on a lot of young people participating in a protest and making their voices heard, which is something Marley relates to      Young people are the future of the world It's a new generation, a new start We can do it better We're growing; as people, we're supposed to grow, we're supposed to learn, and the next generation grows and learns, you know? It's our time now      This probably isn't the first time you've heard from Marley He was also featured on and co-wrote Katy Perry's comeback hit, Chained to the Rhythm      One day Max [Martin, the producer] was playing my song 'Lions' in the studio and Katy was there and she overheard it She was like, 'Who's that? Wait, wait, wait! And next thing I know, I'm getting a call that Katy Perry wants me on her next single Just like that I went into the studio with Max and we were working It was good Katy came in too, that was the first time I met her It was nice Smooth And I'm happy that she chose me as she wanted to put that message out there of having a consciousness      My music stems from reggae of course, but it's an influence of everything My music doesn't even have a genre right now, it's more of an expression All of the influences I get in each song that you hear are little influences of everything\u2014freedom in music, in my music      He's the leader He's the teacher He's shown me so much So it's a continuation really of the same message because the world needs it      Though he was born 15 years after his grandfather's passing, he still has a powerful memory about his legacy      I'll tell you one memory from 2005, I think, in Ethiopia, in Addis Ababa, for a celebration of my grandfather That was the most people I had seen at a concert at that time, at such a young age It was all in celebration of not only my grandfather, but also a continuation That really showed me the power of the music      It's like they knew My Uncle Stephen, he gave me a chance first He brought me on stage to sing 'One Love.' They've always been there for anything I need, any questions      I started writing when was probably 15 or 16 I got put on the stage when I was 14 or 13      Be on the lookout for a full EP from Marley later this year      Hopefully in the summertime But I'm probably going to release another single But the EP is definitely coming out      Here's what we can expect from that project:      Message My music is like food: food for the ears, food for the mind So it's a consciousness and a look on today", "summary": "", "summary_all": "\u2013 \"Live Bolder Live Louder Live for Now\" may be the slogan Pepsi wanted everyone to remember from its new ad starring Kendall Jenner, but the phrases actually being bandied about include \"shallow,\" \"cringeworthy,\" and \"tone deaf.\" The nearly three-minute video was posted Monday on Pepsi Global's YouTube channel and shows Jenner playing a bleach-blond model who's drawn into some kind of vague protest in which demonstrators are marching and holding up posters with peace signs and taglines like \"Join the Conversation.\" There's a dramatic shot of Jenner ripping off her blond wig to join the march, a guy inexplicably lugging a cello around, and the triumphant finale of Jenner's character presenting a stone-faced police officer with a Pepsi, getting him to crack a smile All of which, as Mediaite notes, is spurring a good amount of vitriol online Much of the backlash centers on the appropriation of Black Lives Matter-style symbols and the minimizing of issues such as oppression by having Jenner \"solve\" things with a can of Pepsi It's \"a perfect example of what happens when there's no black people in the room when decisions are being made,\" tweeted comedian Travon Free Per CNBC, some also note Jenner handing the cop a Pepsi resembles a protest photo of mom Ieshia Evans that went viral last year The ad gets a bit of praise from Harper's Bazaar: It notes \"Lions,\" the background song by Bob Marley's grandson Skip Marley, is the one \"redeeming\" part, \"an anthemic call to arms to take action and make a difference while promoting strength and togetherness.\" Pepsi's response, via a statement to CNNMoney: \"This is a global ad that reflects people from different walks of life coming together in a spirit of harmony.\""}

The answers point to a media industry that still takes its \u201cgatekeeping\u201d functions more seriously than it sometimes gets credit for\u2014even if it doesn\u2019t always perform them      BuzzFeed\u2019s editor, Ben Smith, explained the decision in a memo to his staff, which he subsequently provided to me and then published on Twitter:      Here's the note I sent to @buzzfeednews staff this evening pic.twitter.com/OcAloWzVzb \u2014 Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) January 11, 2017      Smith didn\u2019t address why BuzzFeed waited until now to publish the document, and he declined to comment further for this article But the move came almost immediately after CNN reported Tuesday that top U.S intelligence officials had shown Trump and President Obama a two-page synopsis of the dossier The synopsis was presented as an unofficial appendage to the classified security briefings they gave Obama and Trump about Russian interference in the presidential election, CNN reported Sources also told CNN that the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d Congressional leaders had been provided a synopsis of the dossier as well      That top U.S intelligence officials saw fit to brief Trump and Obama on the dossier would seem to indicate that they took the claims at least somewhat seriously, even though they\u2019ve been unable to verify them and, as BuzzFeed noted, the memos contain some \u201cclear errors.\u201d But CNN\u2019s report suggests that the briefing was partly just about making Trump aware that the dossier existed and was circulating at the highest levels of the U.S government      1 For those asking, I didn't publish the full memos from the intelligence operative because I could not confirm the allegations \u2014 David Corn (@DavidCornDC) January 11, 2017      Whether BuzzFeed was right or wrong to publish the memo\u2014and whether it should have presented it with more critical commentary or context\u2014is a question that will be debated in future classes on journalism ethics For now I\u2019ll just point out that, while Smith has at times proudly positioned BuzzFeed as a member of the \u201cmainstream media,\u201d he was acting here in a different tradition It was the tradition of internet media and blogs\u2014one pioneered by Matt Drudge, who famously broke the Monica Lewinsky scandal by reporting that Newsweek was sitting on it, and by the now-defunct Gawker It\u2019s a tradition in which the notion of media as privileged gatekeeper of information is viewed with disdain It\u2019s one in which sensitive and embarrassing information about public figures is readily disclosed, ostensibly out of respect for the public\u2019s intelligence and right to know It\u2019s also one in which publishers are rewarded for publishing such bombshells, not with prestigious industry award, but with notoriety, page views, and social media shares      Smith\u2019s defense of his decision evinces an understanding of this tradition and BuzzFeed\u2019s place in it \u201cWe have always erred on the side of publishing,\u201d he writes There is virtue in this posture among journalists, insofar as it serves as a societal counterweight to the tendency of people in positions of power to suppress information that could embarrass them The question is just how far you\u2019re willing to err in that direction, and Smith acknowledges that this was a particularly close call It rings just a tad disingenuous, however, when BuzzFeed claims to have published the documents simply \u201cso that Americans can make up their own minds\u201d about the allegations If America\u2019s top intelligence agencies, congressional staffs, and investigative journalists\u2014including BuzzFeed\u2019s own decorated investigative team\u2014couldn\u2019t make up their minds about the allegations, how do they expect the average reader to do so?", "summary": "Though he says Smith places BuzzFeed within the mainstream media, \"he was acting here in a different tradition\": that born of the Internet and blogs \"in which sensitive and embarrassing information about public figures is readily disclosed\" under a public-has-a-right-to-know rallying cry", "summary_all": "\u2013 \"The documents have circulated for months and acquired a kind of legendary status among journalists, lawmakers, and intelligence officials who have seen them.\" So writes BuzzFeed in introducing the 35-page dossier it published Tuesday night that alleges Russia has compromising information, both financial and personal, on President-elect Donald Trump Their publication raises some big questions about journalistic ethics: Why did BuzzFeed decide to pull the trigger on publishing in full (in its words) \"unverified, and potentially unverifiable allegations\"? Why now? Why hadn't other outlets (Mother Jones did quote from it in October)? Some perspective: From the horse's mouth: BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith in an email explains what went into the decision to publish the dossier, concluding, the move \"reflects how we see the job of reporters in 2017.\" At Slate, Will Oremus takes a positional view Though he says Smith places BuzzFeed within the mainstream media, \"he was acting here in a different tradition\": that born of the Internet and blogs \"in which sensitive and embarrassing information about public figures is readily disclosed\" under a public-has-a-right-to-know rallying cry At the Atlantic, David A Graham sees that cry as \"an abdication of the basic responsibility of journalism.\" Heaping information into the public's lap is not the reporter's job, he writes \"It is to gather information, sift through it, and determine what is true and what is not.\" Here, for instance, is New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet's explanation of its own decision: \"We, like others, investigated the allegations and haven't corroborated them, and we felt we're not in the business of publishing things we can\u2019t stand by.\" As for that corroboration, Lawfare makes this point: \"This is a document about meetings that either took place or did not take place, stays in hotels that either happened or didn\u2019t, travel that either happened or did not happen It should be possible to know whether at least some of these allegations are true or false.\" ProPublica President Richard Tofel suggests the publication an hour prior to BuzzFeed's dump of a CNN story that reported Trump and President Obama had received a two-page summary of the reports last week, changes the game He tweeted BuzzFeed \"kudos ..

{"article_number": 2763, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": "Update: Three hours after the publication of this story, Schneiderman resigned from his position \u201cWhile these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office\u2019s work at this critical time,\u201d he said in a statement \u201cI therefore resign my office, effective at the close of business on May 8, 2018.\u201d      Manning Barish was romantically involved with Schneiderman from the summer of 2013 until New Year\u2019s Day in 2015 Selvaratnam was with him from the summer of 2016 until the fall of 2017 Both are articulate, progressive Democratic feminists in their forties who live in Manhattan They work and socialize in different circles, and although they have become aware of each other\u2019s stories, they have only a few overlapping acquaintances; to this day, they have never spoken to each other Over the past year, both watched with admiration as other women spoke out about sexual misconduct But, as Schneiderman used the authority of his office to assume a major role in the #MeToo movement, their anguish and anger grew In February, four months after the first stories about Weinstein broke, Schneiderman announced that his office was filing a civil-rights suit against him At a press conference, he denounced Weinstein, saying, \u201cWe have never seen anything as despicable as what we\u2019ve seen right here.\u201d On May 2nd, at the direction of Governor Andrew Cuomo, Schneiderman launched an investigation into the past handling of criminal complaints against Weinstein by the Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, Jr., and the New York City Police Department (In 2015, Vance declined to bring criminal charges against Weinstein, saying that he lacked sufficient evidence\u2014a decision criticized by activist groups.) In a speech, Cuomo explained that \u201csexual-assault complaints must be pursued aggressively, and to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d The expanding investigation of the Weinstein case puts Schneiderman at the center of one of the most significant sexual-misconduct cases in recent history Schneiderman\u2019s activism on behalf of feminist causes has increasingly won him praise from women\u2019s groups On May 1st, the New York-based National Institute for Reproductive Health honored him as one of three \u201cChampions of Choice\u201d at its annual fund-raising luncheon Accepting the award, Schneiderman said, \u201cIf a woman cannot control her body, she is not truly equal.\u201d But, as Manning Barish sees it, \u201cyou cannot be a champion of women when you are hitting them and choking them in bed, and saying to them, \u2018You\u2019re a fucking whore.\u2019 \u201d She says of Schneiderman\u2019s involvement in the Weinstein investigation, \u201cHow can you put a perpetrator in charge of the country\u2019s most important sexual-assault case?\u201d Selvaratnam describes Schneiderman as \u201ca Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\u201d figure, and says that seeing him lauded as a supporter of women has made her \u201cfeel sick,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is a man who has staked his entire career, his personal narrative, on being a champion for women publicly But he abuses them privately He needs to be called out.\u201d Manning Barish notes that many of her friends attended the N.I.R.H luncheon \u201cHis hypocrisy is epic,\u201d she says \u201cHe\u2019s fooled so many people.\u201d Manning Barish includes herself among them She says that she met Schneiderman in July, 2013, through mutual friends She had become a blogger and political activist after opposing her younger brother\u2019s deployment to Iraq and working with groups such as MoveOn.org Amicably divorced from Chris Barish, a hospitality-industry executive, she was a single mother with a young daughter and socially prominent friends Schneiderman, who was rising in Democratic politics after being elected attorney general, in 2010, was also divorced His ex-wife, Jennifer Cunningham, a lobbyist and political strategist at the firm SKDKnickerbocker, currently serves as one of his political consultants They have a grown daughter Manning Barish says that she fell quickly for Schneiderman and was happy to be involved with someone who seemed to share her progressive idealism and enjoy her feistiness Page Six chronicled the romance, calling her a \u201cravishing redhead\u201d and noting that, at a fund-raiser, the television producer Norman Lear had introduced her as Schneiderman\u2019s \u201cbride-to-be.\u201d But Manning Barish began to see signs of controlling and abusive behavior Soon after she started dating Schneiderman, he told her to remove a small tattoo from her wrist; it wasn\u2019t appropriate, he said, if she were to become the wife of a politician The process of having it removed was painful and expensive In retrospect, she says, it was the first step in trying to control her body \u201cTaking a strong woman and tearing her to pieces is his jam,\u201d she says About four weeks after they became physically involved, she says, Schneiderman grew violent One night, they were in the bedroom of his Upper West Side apartment, still clothed but getting ready for bed, and lightly baiting each other As she recalls it, he called her \u201ca whore,\u201d and she talked back They had both been drinking, and her recollection of their conversation is blurry, but what happened next remains vivid Schneiderman, she says, backed her up to the edge of his bed \u201cAll of a sudden, he just slapped me, open-handed and with great force, across the face, landing the blow directly onto my ear,\u201d Manning Barish says \u201cIt was horrendous It just came out of nowhere My ear was ringing I lost my balance and fell backward onto the bed I sprang up, but at this point there was very little room between the bed and him I got up to try to shove him back, or take a swing, and he pushed me back down He then used his body weight to hold me down, and he began to choke me The choking was very hard It was really bad I kicked In every fibre, I felt I was being beaten by a man.\u201d She finally freed herself and got back on her feet \u201cI was crying and in shock,\u201d she says She recalls shouting, \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d To her astonishment, Schneiderman accused her of scratching him At one point\u2014she can\u2019t remember if it was at this moment or in a later conversation\u2014he told her, \u201cYou know, hitting an officer of the law is a felony.\u201d After the incident, Manning Barish left the apartment, telling him that she would never come back \u201cI want to make it absolutely clear,\u201d she says \u201cThis was under no circumstances a sex game gone wrong This did not happen while we were having sex I was fully dressed and remained that way It was completely unexpected and shocking I did not consent to physical assault.\u201d In the following days, Manning Barish confided to three close female friends that Schneiderman had hit her All of them have confirmed this to The New Yorker \u201cShe was distraught,\u201d one of the friends, a high-profile media figure, says \u201cShe was very, very upset This wasn\u2019t a gentle smack He clocked her ear I was shocked.\u201d She notes, \u201cMichelle had mentioned that he drank a lot, and that he changed under the influence of alcohol, but I\u2019d never anticipated that he would be violent.\u201d The friend describes Manning Barish as having seemed \u201csad\u201d and \u201ctorn,\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019d really wanted the relationship to work.\u201d The novelist Salman Rushdie, who dated Manning Barish before Schneiderman did, and who has been her close friend for nearly fifteen years, says that she confided in him as well \u201cShe called me and told me he had hit her,\u201d Rushdie recalls \u201cShe was obviously very upset I was horrified.\u201d In his view, Schneiderman\u2019s behavior does not fall into the kind of gray area that should remain private \u201cIt was clear to me that it crossed a line,\u201d he says Rushdie, who describes Manning Barish as \u201ca very truthful person, in my experience,\u201d advised her to stay away from Schneiderman But Manning Barish went back to him, a decision that she regrets After the attack, she says, Schneiderman \u201ccalled and called\u201d her A few days later, on a weekday afternoon, his security detail drove him to her apartment, and he showed up at her door with an armload of flowers and a case of wine She found the wine surprising, given the fact that alcohol had fuelled his violent behavior She recalls saying over and over, \u201cYou hit me! You hurt me! You should never hit a woman!\u201d But he didn\u2019t want to talk about having hit her \u201cThe hitting was not an issue for him,\u201d she says Before long, they reconciled Manning Barish says that her ear bothered her for months It often felt painful and clogged, and she kept hearing odd gurgling sounds Once, blood trickled out, reaching her collarbone Eventually, Manning Barish sought medical help from Dr Gwen Korovin, an ear, nose, and throat specialist Manning Barish shared her medical records with The New Yorker They confirm that, on September 13, 2014, Korovin found and removed \u201cdried bloody crust\u201d from Manning Barish\u2019s ear Manning Barish thought that the slap might have caused the injury, but when Korovin asked her what had happened she said that she might have injured herself with a Q-tip \u201cI was protecting Eric,\u201d Manning Barish says \u201cAnd I was ashamed For victims, shame plays a huge role in most of these stories I want people to know that.\u201d Korovin was asked by The New Yorker if the injury could have been caused by a slap \u201cYes, it could be consistent with a slap,\u201d she said \u201cYou could perforate an eardrum in a lot of ways, with a Q-tip or with a slap.\u201d Manning Barish and Schneiderman were together, off and on, for nearly two years She says that when they had sex he often slapped her across the face without her consent, and that she felt \u201cemotionally battered\u201d by cruel remarks that he made She says that he criticized how she looked and dressed, and \u201ccontrolled what I ate.\u201d Manning Barish, who is five feet seven, lost thirty pounds, falling to a hundred and three In a photograph from the period, she looks emaciated; her hair, she recalls, started to fall out Nevertheless, he squeezed her legs and called them \u201cchubby.\u201d Manning Barish says that Schneiderman pressed her to consume huge amounts of alcohol She recalls, \u201cI would come over for dinner An already half-empty bottle of red wine would be on the counter He had had a head start \u2018Very stressful day,\u2019 he would say.\u201d Sometimes, if she didn\u2019t drink quickly enough, she says, he would \u201ccome to me like a baby who wouldn\u2019t eat its food, and hold the glass to my lips while holding my face, and sweetly but forcefully, like a parent, say, \u2018Come on, Mimi, drink, drink, drink,\u2019 and essentially force me\u2014at times actually spilling it down my chin and onto my chest.\u201d Schneiderman, she recalls, \u201cwould almost always drink two bottles of wine in a night, then bring a bottle of Scotch into the bedroom He would get absolutely plastered five nights out of seven.\u201d On one occasion, she recalls, \u201che literally fell on his face in my kitchen, straight down, like a tree falling.\u201d Another evening, he smashed his leg against an open drawer, cutting it so badly that \u201cthere was blood all over the place.\u201d She bandaged it, but the next day she went to his office to change the dressing, because the bleeding hadn\u2019t stopped Manning Barish says that Schneiderman also took prescription tranquillizers, and often asked her to refill a prescription that she had for Xanax, so that he could reserve \u201cabout half\u201d the pills for himself (Schneiderman\u2019s spokesperson said that he has \u201cnever commandeered anyone\u2019s medications.\u201d) Sometimes in bed, she recalls, he would be \u201cshaking me and grabbing my face\u201d while demanding that she repeat such things as \u201cI\u2019m a little whore.\u201d She says that he also told her, \u201cIf you ever left me, I\u2019d kill you.\u201d Evan Stark, a forensic social worker and an emeritus professor at Rutgers, is the author of a landmark book, \u201cCoercive Control,\u201d in which he argues that domestic abuse is just as often psychological as it is physical Abusive men, he writes, often \u201cterrorize\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d their partners by demeaning them, particularly about the traits or accomplishments of which they are proudest Manning Barish says that Schneiderman often mocked her political activism When she told him of her plan to attend an anti-gun demonstration with various political figures and a group of parents from Sandy Hook Elementary School, he dismissed the effort, calling the demonstrators \u201closers.\u201d He added, \u201cGo ahead, if it makes you feel better to do your little political things.\u201d When she was using her computer, he\u2019d sometimes say, \u201cOh, look at little Mimi So cute\u2014she\u2019s working!\u201d He told Manning Barish that, because she had childcare, she wasn\u2019t \u201ca real single mother.\u201d Manning Barish broke up with Schneiderman a second time, and then got back together with him He\u2019d been talking about marrying her, she says, and she somehow convinced herself that the real problem between them was her fear of commitment In January, 2015, she ended the relationship a third time, feeling degraded After that, they got together romantically a few more times, but since 2016 she has been in touch with him only sporadically Since the #MeToo movement began, Manning Barish has been active on social-media platforms, cheering on women who have spoken out, including those whose accusations prompted the resignation of the Minnesota senator Al Franken, a widely admired Democrat Once, she made an oblique reference to Schneiderman on social media, in connection with a political issue He called her and, in a tone that she describes as \u201cnasty,\u201d said, \u201cDon\u2019t ever write about me You don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d Manning Barish says that she took his remarks as a threat, just as she took seriously a comment that he\u2019d once made after she objected to him \u201cyanking\u201d her across a street She recalls saying to him, \u201cJaywalking is against the law,\u201d and him responding, \u201cI am the law.\u201d Manning Barish says, \u201cIf there is a sentence that sums him up, it\u2019s that.\u201d      Schneiderman was elected to the New York State Senate in 1998, and served for twelve years He wrote many laws, including one that created specific penalties for strangulation He introduced the bill in 2010, after chairing a committee that investigated domestic-violence charges against the former state senator Hiram Monserrate, a Democrat, who was expelled from the legislature after having been convicted of assaulting his girlfriend During the hearings, the legislators learned that New York State imposed no specific criminal penalty for choking, even though it is a common prelude to domestic-violence homicides Not only did Schneiderman\u2019s bill make life-threatening strangulation a grave crime; it also criminalized less serious cases involving \u201can intent to impede breathing\u201d as misdemeanors punishable by up to a year in prison \u201cI\u2019m just sorry it took us so long in New York State to do this,\u201d Schneiderman declared at the time \u201cI think this will save a lot of lives.\u201d Jennifer Friedman, a legal expert on domestic violence, says that she cannot square Schneiderman\u2019s public and private behavior Anyone knowledgeable about intimate-partner violence, she says, knows that choking is \u201ca known lethality indicator.\u201d She adds, \u201cI cannot fathom that someone who drafted the legislation on strangulation is unfamiliar with such concepts.\u201d She also says, \u201cA slap is not just a slap\u2014it reverberates through the rest of the relationship, making her afraid of setting him off.\u201d She adds, \u201cPeople aren\u2019t usually prosecuted for it, but, in the state of New York, slapping is assault when it results in pain or physical injury.\u201d In the summer of 2016, the attorney general may have crossed this line again He went to a party in the Hamptons, where he drank heavily, and invited another guest\u2014a woman he\u2019d known for some time\u2014to join him at an after-party An accomplished Ivy League-educated lawyer with government experience, she had worked closely with his office in the past, and supported him politically She says that she agreed to let a man in Schneiderman\u2019s security detail drive them to the next destination But, when they arrived at the house, there was no party; it was where Schneiderman was staying The security officer left the property The lawyer and Schneiderman began making out, but he said things that repelled her He told the woman, a divorced mother, that professional women with big jobs and children had so many decisions to make that, when it came to sex, they secretly wanted men to take charge She recalls him saying, \u201cYeah, you act a certain way and look a certain way, but I know that at heart you are a dirty little slut You want to be my whore.\u201d He became more sexually aggressive, but she was repulsed by his talk, and pulled away from him She says that \u201csuddenly\u2014at least, in my mind\u2019s eye\u2014he drew back, and there was a moment where I was, like, \u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019 \u201d Then, she recalls, \u201cHe slapped me across the face hard, twice,\u201d adding, \u201cI was stunned.\u201d Schneiderman hit her so hard, she says, that the blow left a red handprint \u201cWhat the fuck did you just do?\u201d she screamed, and started to sob \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d she recalls \u201cFor a split second, I was scared.\u201d She notes that, in all her years of dating, she has never been in a situation like the one with Schneiderman \u201cHe just really smacked me,\u201d she says When she told him that she wanted to leave, she recalls, he started to \u201cfreak out,\u201d saying that he\u2019d misjudged her \u201cYou\u2019d really be surprised,\u201d he claimed \u201cA lot of women like it They don\u2019t always think they like it, but then they do, and they ask for more.\u201d She again demanded to be taken home They got into his car, and it quickly became apparent how intoxicated he was As he drove, weaving along back roads, she was terrified that he\u2019d kill not just her but another driver She says that Schneiderman \u201cbroke the law at least once that night.\u201d (\u201cThis is untrue,\u201d Schneiderman\u2019s spokesperson said.) The next day, she told two friends, and sent them a photograph of the mark on her face (Both women corroborate this.) Another photograph of the lawyer, taken later that day at a family birthday party, shows faint raised marks splayed on her cheek One of the friends says of Schneiderman, \u201cHe seemed not to know what the word \u2018consent\u2019 means.\u201d Given the woman\u2019s prominence in the legal sphere, Schneiderman\u2019s actions had exposed him to tremendous risk Yet she took no official action against him \u201cNow that I know it\u2019s part of a pattern, I think, God, I should have reported it,\u201d she says \u201cBut, back then, I believed that it was a one-time incident And I thought, He\u2019s a good attorney general, he\u2019s doing good things I didn\u2019t want to jeopardize that.\u201d She notes that he did not hit her again, after she protested Nevertheless, she says of the assault, \u201cI knew it was wrong,\u201d adding, \u201cOur top law officer, this guy with a platform for women\u2019s rights, just smacked away so much of what I thought he stood for.\u201d      Tanya Selvaratnam is the author of \u201cThe Big Lie: Motherhood, Feminism, and the Reality of the Biological Clock,\u201d which explores infertility issues; she is also an actor and a film producer, as well as a supporter of feminist and progressive social causes She, too, is divorced In 2016, she attended the Democratic National Convention, in Philadelphia, where Schneiderman introduced himself to her She says that their first encounter felt \u201clike kismet.\u201d They had both gone to Harvard: she as an undergraduate and a graduate student, he as a law student She was impressed when he expressed an interest in meditation and Buddhism They had both studied Chinese, and, when he asked, in Mandarin, if she spoke the language, she answered, \u201cWo shuo keshi bu tai liuli\u201d\u2014\u201cYes, but not fluently.\u201d They began dating, and appeared to be a happy couple Selvaratnam all but lived in his apartment, attending political functions and dinners with his friends and donors, and brainstorming with him on speeches and projects But, as she puts it, \u201cit was a fairy tale that became a nightmare.\u201d Although Schneiderman often doted on her, he demanded that she spend more and more time with him, and he began physically abusing her in bed \u201cThe slaps started after we\u2019d gotten to know each other,\u201d she recalls \u201cIt was at first as if he were testing me Then it got stronger and harder.\u201d Selvaratnam says, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t consensual This wasn\u2019t sexual playacting This was abusive, demeaning, threatening behavior.\u201d When Schneiderman was violent, he often made sexual demands \u201cHe was obsessed with having a threesome, and said it was my job to find a woman,\u201d she says \u201cHe said he\u2019d have nothing to look forward to if I didn\u2019t, and would hit me until I agreed.\u201d (She had no intention of having a threesome.) She recalls, \u201cSometimes, he\u2019d tell me to call him Master, and he\u2019d slap me until I did.\u201d Selvaratnam, who was born in Sri Lanka, has dark skin, and she recalls that \u201che started calling me his \u2018brown slave\u2019 and demanding that I repeat that I was \u2018his property.\u2019 \u201d The abuse escalated Schneiderman not only slapped her across the face, often four or five times, back and forth, with his open hand; he also spat at her and choked her \u201cHe was cutting off my ability to breathe,\u201d she says Eventually, she says, \u201cwe could rarely have sex without him beating me.\u201d In her view, Schneiderman \u201cis a misogynist and a sexual sadist.\u201d She says that she often asked him to stop hurting her, and tried to push him away At other times, she gave in, rationalizing that she could tolerate the violence if it happened only once a week or so during sex But \u201cthe emotional and verbal abuse started increasing,\u201d she says, and \u201cthe belittling and demeaning of me carried over into our nonsexual encounters.\u201d He told her to get plastic surgery to remove scars on her torso that had resulted from an operation to remove cancerous tumors He criticized her hair and said that she should get breast implants and buy different clothes He mocked some of her friends as \u201cditzes,\u201d and, when these women attended a birthday celebration for her, he demanded that she leave just as the cake was arriving \u201cI began to feel like I was in Hell,\u201d she says Like Manning Barish, Selvaratnam says that Schneiderman routinely drank heavily\u2014a bottle and a half of wine, or more He also took sedatives, she says, and pushed her to drink with him, saying, \u201cDrink your bourbon, Turnip\u201d\u2014his nickname for her In the middle of the night, he staggered through the apartment, as if in a trance \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone that messed up,\u201d she recalls \u201cIt was like sleeping next to a monster.\u201d The next morning, she says, he\u2019d seem fine, but often berated her for not having kept him away from the alcohol His emotional state seemed to worsen after the 2016 Presidential election He had counted on forging an ambitious partnership with a White House led by Hillary Clinton Instead, the Presidency had gone to Donald Trump Earlier, Schneiderman\u2019s office had sued Trump University for civil fraud, and Trump had countersued Schneiderman personally On the morning of January 19, 2017, the day before Trump\u2019s Inauguration, Schneiderman called Selvaratnam from a hospital emergency room She recalls, \u201cHe told me that he\u2019d been drinking the night before, and he fell down He didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d cut himself, and got into bed, and when he woke up he was in a pool of blood.\u201d Selvaratnam rushed to the hospital Schneiderman had several stitches above his left eye; his face was puffy and bruised He had her send his press secretary a photograph of the injury, and they agreed to cancel a public appearance In the image, which was shared with The New Yorker, Schneiderman has a black eye and a bandage across the left side of his forehead Schneiderman then called Cunningham, his ex-wife and political consultant, and they agreed that he and Selvaratnam should tell anyone who asked about the injury that he had fallen \u201cwhile running.\u201d (A spokesperson for Schneiderman said, \u201cOne morning, Mr Schneiderman fell in the bathroom while completely sober, hit his head, and had to go the E.R for stitches Because he was embarrassed to tell his staff he fell in the bathroom, he told them he fell while running.\u201d Cunningham, in a statement issued shortly after this story was published online, said, \u201cI\u2019ve known Eric for nearly thirty-five years as a husband, father, and friend These allegations are completely inconsistent with the man I know, who has always been someone of the highest character, outstanding values, and a loving father I find it impossible to believe these allegations are true.\u201d) Selvaratnam understands how incomprehensible it may seem that she stayed in such an abusive relationship for more than a year But, she says, \u201cnow I see how independent women get stuck in one.\u201d The physical abuse, she notes, \u201chappens quickly\u201d: \u201cHe\u2019s drunk, and you\u2019re naked and at your most vulnerable It\u2019s so disorienting You lose a little of who you are.\u201d She kept telling herself that she could help him change, and tried to get him to see a therapist At times, she blamed herself for his behavior \u201cI was scared what he might do if I left him,\u201d she says \u201cHe had said he would have to kill me if we broke up, on multiple occasions He also told me he could have me followed and could tap my phone.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if Schneiderman was serious when he made such remarks, but Selvaratnam says that she felt intimidated Jacquelyn Campbell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, is the author of a danger-assessment checklist that helps authorities gauge the likelihood of homicide in domestic-violence situations She says, \u201cIt\u2019s often true that women don\u2019t know whether to take threats to kill seriously But we should always take threats seriously It\u2019s categorized as a violent act, and you can report someone to the police for it.\u201d Selvaratnam began to spend more time apart from Schneiderman, and last fall she ended the relationship She\u2019d been suffering from ringing in her ears, and sometimes had vertigo After the breakup, she, like Manning Barish, sought medical help from an ear, nose, and throat specialist The doctor could find no specific cause for her ailments The writer Danzy Senna, a close friend of Selvaratnam\u2019s, recalls, \u201cShe was thin, fragile, and shaky.\u201d Selvaratnam confided to Senna about the abuse, and Senna was so shocked that she wrote down the details and e-mailed the account to her husband, so that there would be a dated copy of it should any harm come to her friend Senna\u2019s document, which she shared with The New Yorker, is dated September 16, 2017, and says, in part, \u201cShe told me that her boyfriend of a year, Eric Schneiderman, the Attorney General of New York, has been choking, beating, and threatening her for the entirety of their relationship, and that several times he threatened to have her killed if she ever tried to leave him She said he knows that she has a lot of really damning information about him, his alcoholism, sexual deviance, and drug use, and she worries about her safety.\u201d Senna advised Selvaratnam to retrieve her belongings from his apartment On November 3, 2017, she did so, with another friend\u2014Jennifer Gonnerman, a staff writer at this magazine As they carried her things outside, they talked about the fact that Selvaratnam couldn\u2019t possibly be the only woman who had seen this side of Schneiderman Gonnerman asked her who else he had dated Selvaratnam knew of one former girlfriend\u2014not Manning Barish\u2014and described where she had worked The next day, Gonnerman happened to run into a male friend who had once worked with the former girlfriend Gonnerman asked him if he\u2019d ever known anyone who had dated Schneiderman He said yes: a close friend of his had Without divulging anything, Gonnerman asked, \u201cSo how did that work out?\u201d He answered, \u201cHe used to spit on her and slap her during sex.\u201d Gonnerman told Selvaratnam about the other victim \u201cShe was very traumatized,\u201d Gonnerman recalls \u201cOn the one hand, she was relieved to learn it had happened before, but on the other it was, like, \u2018Why hasn\u2019t anyone stopped him?\u2019 \u201d Selvaratnam says, \u201cI wished someone had warned me And I wondered, Who\u2019s next?\u201d She notes, \u201cI was not planning to come forward, until I found out there was another woman The silence of women before me meant that I\u2019d suffered, too I felt, I will not be able to live with myself if I hear of him doing this to another woman years or months from now.\u201d Selvaratnam reached out to the former girlfriend, and they agreed to meet In February, Selvaratnam recalls, they sat outside on a bench for ninety minutes, and their stories came flooding forth Selvaratnam says that she was astounded to discover how similar their experiences had been Selvaratnam kept notes about her exchanges with the former girlfriend, and she described them to The New Yorker According to these notes, the former girlfriend told Selvaratnam that she had been in love with Schneiderman, but that in bed he had routinely slapped her hard across the ear and the face, as tears rolled down her cheeks He also choked her and spat at her Not all the abuse had taken place in a sexual context She said that Schneiderman had once slapped her during an argument they\u2019d had while getting dressed to go out The blow left a handprint on her back; the next day, the spot still hurt When the former girlfriend objected to this mistreatment, he told her that she simply wasn\u2019t \u201cliberated\u201d enough Just as Schneiderman had done with the other women, he had pushed her to drink with him and to set up a threesome, and he had belittled her work and appearance, saying in her case that she had fat legs and needed Botox After the former girlfriend ended the relationship, she told several friends about the abuse A number of them advised her to keep the story to herself, arguing that Schneiderman was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose She described this response as heartbreaking And when Schneiderman heard that she had turned against him, she said, he warned her that politics was a tough and personal business, and that she\u2019d better be careful She told Selvaratnam that she had taken this as a threat The former girlfriend told Selvaratnam she found it \u201cshameless\u201d that Schneiderman was casting himself as a leading supporter of the #MeToo movement She promised to support Selvaratnam if she spoke out, but she wasn\u2019t sure that she could risk joining her The former girlfriend told Selvaratnam she\u2019d once been so afraid of Schneiderman that she\u2019d written down an extensive account of the abuse, locked the document in a safe-deposit box, and given keys to two friends", "summary": "", "summary_all": "\u2013 A New York lawyer said he told Trump

Friday that he was contacted \"some years ago\" by two women who claimed Schneiderman was \"sexually inappropriate\" with them Gleason said he advised the women not to report what happened to

president Gleason said he then got a call from Cohen and \"shared with him certain details\" of Schneiderman's \"vile attacks\" on the women In his letter, Gleason asked US District Judge Kimba Wood to issue a protective order sealing all relevant correspondence with Cohen In a phone interview Friday, Gleason confirmed that Cohen told him during their 2013 conversation that if Trump were elected governor, he would make the allegations about Schneiderman public He added that shortly after that conversation, Trump tweeted about Schneiderman \"Weiner is gone Spitzer is gone - next will be

{"article_number": 3154, "article_idx": 0, "article_text": "President Obama charted a middle course Wednesday for ending the U.S military involvement in Afghanistan, outlining a departure plan that will remove troops faster than his commanders had requested but more slowly than many of his political allies would like      In a prime-time address from the White House, Obama said he will bring home 10,000 U.S troops by the end of the year and 23,000 more by next summer, a withdrawal window that will conclude two months before voters decide whether to give him a second term The first troops will leave Afghanistan next month      In contrast to his 2009 decision to send additional forces to Afghanistan, Obama appeared to give greater weight this time to the growing impatience of a war-weary public and a skeptical Congress, whose members have been demanding a rapid drawdown and a narrower mission after nearly a decade of battle      Obama was a relatively new commander in chief when he authorized the troop \u201csurge\u201d 18 months ago Today he is a candidate for reelection at the head of a party deeply opposed to the war, and he emphasized his push to end the U.S military presence in Afghanistan and Iraq to \u201creclaim the American dream that is at the center of our story.\u201d      \u201cOver the last decade, we have spent $1 trillion on war, at a time of rising debt and hard economic times,\u201d he said in a 13-minute address that sounded at times like a campaign speech \u201cAmerica, it is time to focus on nation-building here at home.\u201d      Obama\u2019s decision drew a measured response from Capitol Hill, where some Democrats indicated that they will continue to pressure the president for a faster withdrawal      In a statement, Sen Carl M Levin (D-Mich.), the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, called the plan a \u201cpositive development, although in my view the conditions on the ground justify an even larger drawdown of U.S troops.\u201d      He added: \u201cThis is not the \u2018modest\u2019 withdrawal that I and others had hoped for and advocated.\u201d      Obama\u2019s plan will also influence U.S allies in Afghanistan, which supply about 40,000 troops \u2014 about 30 percent of the international forces there Some European leaders are as eager as Obama to end their expensive and politically unpopular commitments to the Afghanistan war effort, and they welcomed the president\u2019s announcement      On Thursday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said France will pull its 4,000 troops out of Afghanistan on the same staggered timetable as the U.S withdrawal German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said his country wants to reduce the German contingent of 4,900 troops by the end of 2011--but has not yet formulated a withdrawal plan      Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who along with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and European leaders was briefed by Obama in advance of the speech, also cheered Obama\u2019s announcement, saying \u201ctoday is a very happy day\u201d for Afghanistan      But the Taliban said it considered Obama\u2019s drawdown plan \u201conly as a symbolic step which will never satisfy the war-weary international community or the American people.\u201d      That decision, largely consistent with the request of his military commanders, followed a months-long strategy review designed to correct the downward course of a conflict that Obama as a candidate called \u201cthe war we need to win.\u201d      Petraeus presented Obama with a range of withdrawal proposals \u2014 some, administration officials acknowledged, that would keep the surge forces in Afghanistan far longer than Obama had envisioned But the adopted plan, those officials said, has the military\u2019s support      They also argued that maintaining pressure on the battlefield would benefit U.S efforts to broker a reconciliation between Karzai, an unpredictable ally, and the Taliban, which the administration has determined cannot be eliminated as a political force      \u201cThanks to the pressure delivered by the surge, we\u2019re in active support of Afghan initiatives to reach out to the Taliban and explore what might be possible by way of a political settlement,\u201d said a second administration official \u201cAnd there are openings today that simply didn\u2019t exist 18 months ago.\u201d      In the weeks preceding his decision, Obama confronted mounting criticism of maintaining a large U.S presence in Afghanistan at a time of economic distress and fiscal constraint at home      Administration officials said Vice President Biden, who led a faction of civilian advisers who argued against a large troop surge in 2009, is pleased with Obama\u2019s withdrawal schedule, even though it is not as quick as Biden had hoped it would be      Biden and other senior White House officials, including national security adviser Thomas E Donilon, had pushed for a significantly larger number of the surge forces to return by the end of this year      The war effort costs the United States about $10 billion a month \u2014 a figure some congressional leaders have called \u201cunsustainable\u201d \u2014 and a majority of Americans no longer think the battle is worth fighting Since the surge began, 684 U.S troops have been killed in Afghanistan      Even congressional Republicans, long the bedrock of support for Obama\u2019s war policy, have called for a faster drawdown and a sharper focus on destroying al-Qaeda rather than

(Associated Press)      But with 100,000 U.S troops currently in Afghanistan, that drawdown may not be substantial enough to satisfy some lawmakers on Capitol Hill and a war-weary public      The initial withdrawal is expected to happen in two phases, with 5,000 troops coming home this summer and an additional 5,000 by the end of the year, a senior U.S defense official said      Obama's expected blueprint focuses on the 30,000 surge forces he ordered to Afghanistan as part of his 2009 decision to send reinforcements to reverse the Taliban's battlefield momentum      The president reached his decision a week after receiving a range of options from Gen David Petraeus, the top U.S and NATO commander in Afghanistan Obama informed his senior national security advisers, including outgoing Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, of his plans during a White House meeting Tuesday      The withdrawals would put the U.S on a path toward giving Afghans control of their security by 2014 and ultimately shifting the U.S military from a combat role to a mission focused on training and supporting Afghan forces      The Obama administration has said its goal in continuing the Afghanistan war is to blunt the Taliban insurgency and dismantle and defeat al-Qaida, the terror network that used the country as a training ground for the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S As of Tuesday, at least 1,522 members of the U.S military had died in Afghanistan as a result of the U.S invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001, according to an Associated Press count      The U.S and its allies have set Dec 31, 2014, as a target date for ending the combat mission in Afghanistan      A reduction this year totaling 10,000 troops would be the rough equivalent of two brigades, which are the main building blocks of an Army division It's not clear whether Obama's decision would require the Pentagon to pull out two full brigades or, instead, withdraw a collection of smaller combat and support units with an equivalent number of troops      Under that scenario, the emphasis in U.S.-led military operations is likely to shift away from troop-intensive counterinsurgency operations toward more narrowly focused counterterrorism operations, which focus on capturing and killing insurgents      Afghan security forces and judicial institutions are expected to take up many aspects of the counterinsurgency fight by establishing the rule of law and respect for government institutions, U.S officials in Afghanistan said Tuesday      Some U.S military commanders have favored a more gradual reduction in troops than Obama is expected to announce Wednesday night, arguing that too fast a withdrawal could undermine the fragile security gains      Obama previously has said he favors a significant withdrawal beginning in July, his self-imposed deadline for starting to bring U.S troops home Aides, however, have never quantified that statement      Pressure for a substantial withdrawal has been mounting from the public and Congress Even Gates, who has said he favored a modest withdrawal, said Tuesday that Obama's decision needed to incorporate domestic concerns about the war      It goes without saying that there are a lot of reservations in the Congress about the war in Afghanistan and our level of commitment, Gates said during a news conference at the State Department There are concerns among the American people who are tired of a decade of war      According to an Associated Press-GfK poll last month, 80 percent of Americans say they approve of Obama's decision to begin withdrawal of combat troops in July and end U.S combat operations in Afghanistan by 2014 Just 15 percent disapprove", "summary": "\u2013 A few hours ahead of President Obama's prime-time address on Afghanistan, administration officials are leaking some main points to the AP, Washington Post, and the New York Times: Obama will bring home 10,000 troops this year and another 20,000 or so by the end of next summer Another 70,000 US troops would remain in the country heading into 2013", "summary_all": "\u2013 A few hours ahead of President Obama's prime-time address on Afghanistan, administration officials are leaking some main points to the AP, Washington Post, and the New York Times: Obama will bring home 10,000 troops this year and another 20,000 or so by the end of next summer Those combined withdrawals will effectively mean the return home of all the \"surge\" troops Obama sent to Afghanistan in 2009 Another 70,000 US troops would remain in the country heading into 2013 The timeline does not please Gen David Petraeus, who wants the surge troops to remain through the end of 2012\u2014long enough for another season of fighting (The Times says Petraeus did not endorse the decision, though Robert Gates and Hillary Clinton did with reluctance.)

Me: Wow, I\u2019ve never heard of a vagus nerve implant surgery What kind of person gets a surgery like that, to treat what kind of condition?      Ami: The surgery has been used as a treatment for epilepsy, depression, obesity, and more Recently a surgically implanted vagus nerve stimulation device got FDA indications for obesity But those are medical devices We\u2019re a lifestyle and wellness device, and we\u2019re not seeking FDA approval or making medical claims      Ami: As a company we\u2019ll eventually look at delving into the medical device world I think universities will be very interested in using this They haven\u2019t been able to to treat patients effectively since often surgery isn\u2019t an option      Me: Honestly if I had one of these sets I\u2019d be doing this every day Are you sure there isn\u2019t any harm in doing this over and over? How often do you guys do it?      Ami: Based on all the literature that\u2019s out there, there\u2019s really no harm We actually don\u2019t have a device ourselves right now, but the engineers building the devices try them out all the time We start pre-sale of the device in the next week or two on our site, and then we\u2019ll be delivering it in the spring The price point is $299, which we think is pretty reasonable      Me: Explain to me the connection to music I was encouraged to turn the music to the highest volume that was enjoyable, I cranked up the intensity, and I started noticing the effects as the beat dropped Is that what you expected?      Greg: Yes, that\u2019s the intent of adding it to music The signal rides the wave of the music itself The music is playing at a particular frequency, the the signal follows the rhythm Every once in a while, it\u2019ll be off because it happens to be following one instrument rather than another, but it follows in a pleasurable way      Ami: It\u2019s a very personal device, you can completely adjust the settings You can kind of play around with the settings, like, do I want to feel more intense signal? Do I feel that good feeling more if I increase the signal or do I just want a little mild setting?      Me: I can see so many applications of this at festivals and concerts Have you thought about that?      Me: I\u2019ve got to ask you guys about drugs Any comments on how the experience of this compares, potentially, to a substance like ecstasy or MDMA?      Greg: I couldn\u2019t comment because I just drink alcohol      Ami: Yes! We talk about it all the time, but we haven\u2019t been able to decide yet who gets to go first We all volunteer I think there\u2019s an applicability there, heightening the pleasure experience in what already is a good thing We started off being a device to help you relax, but in what situation is pleasure better than when you\u2019re relaxed? So sex is definitely at the top of our list      Greg: Oh sure, absolutely Why wouldn\u2019t it be? When you talk about virtual reality, you\u2019re talking about five or six senses, depending on who you are But when you\u2019re looking and feeling something, why wouldn\u2019t you also want to, like, hear a truck go by and have a signal there that makes you feel something different?", "summary": "", "summary_all": "\u2013 A new company that's betting there's a big market out there for folks who'd like to, say, enjoy a runner's high without having to, well, run are about to unleash a new device that could very well induce a dopamine high Florida-based Nervana, a wearable tech company run by nurses, doctors, and engineers, is about to take pre-orders for its $299 electric headphones with an anticipated spring delivery, reports Discovery But the science is still out: While Nervana reports that its proprietary earbud tech sends electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve by way of the ear canal to stimulate feel-good hormones like dopamine, the company calls it a \"lifestyle and wellness\" device instead of a medical device, thereby sidestepping rigorous scientific inquiry, FDA approval, and the like Anecdotally, early reviews are somewhat divided The folks who tried the device out for Futurism at the Consumer Electronics Show this week had only praise; the writer notes that dopamine has \"special effects\" for women and goes so far as to confess, \"Honestly if I had one of these sets I'd be doing this every day.\" Engadget writer Daniel Cooper, meanwhile, describes his 15 minutes with the headphones differently, having felt only a \"mild sense of elation that lasted until I shut down the device, and for the next five minutes, I was a little spaced out.\" He notes the elation may have simply been due to the fact that he'd been given momentary respite from the loud din of a trade show (Check out other notable gizmos at this year's CES.)"}

smaller than a wolf, and hunted in packs \u2014 and how strange they sounded      Wolves are known to have a rendezvous point where, in the evening, individual wolves that may be sleeping all over get together as a pack to go off hunting, said Myers, a now-retired professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Michigan Based at U-M's Biological Station in Cheboygan County, researchers had found dens, and what they thought was a rendezvous point      So, one night last August, Myers parked his pickup about a quarter-mile from the spot and listened      As the full moon goes up above the jackpines, one of these things starts howling \u2014 it wasn't the yipping of a coyote or the full voice of a wolf; but a hoarse, sustained call, he said      About five minutes later, I hear a bark from my right, then a bark from my left, five or six of them I was surrounded by them But this was in forest and swampland; these were no dogs Those were pack-mates coming into this rendezvous point      Myers' close encounter was with a unique, still relatively unknown and misunderstood hybrid of coyotes known as eastern coyotes or coywolves They're mostly coyote, but contain a small percentage of wolf from an unlikely mating of the two species about a century ago It may sound like an urban legend, but coywolves exist throughout the northeastern U.S and eastern Canada, and have been confirmed in northeast Lower Michigan through blood-testing and DNA analysis      Buy Photo The coywolf, or Eastern coyote, is a slightly larger, hybrid coyote that includes a small percentage of wolf DNA (Photo: Detroit Free Press)      I know too many people who are knowledgeable people who have seen them, he said      Coyote expert Stan Gehrt, a professor of wildlife ecology at Ohio State University, rejects the term coywolf He doesn't even like referring to them as hybrids It leaves the impression that they are a near 50-50 mix of wolf and coyote, and that just isn't the case, he said      They are eastern coyotes, Gehrt said They aren't really different from other coyotes, other than they have a little bit of genetic difference I've trapped and tracked hundreds of Midwestern coyotes and a pretty good sample of eastern coyotes in Nova Scotia, and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the two      Kleitch got to see the coywolves that were trapped in October up close She'd never seen anything like it      It was strange, she said The nose was a little narrow for a wolf, but the feet were large like a wolf They were the young of the year and they were females, and the weights on them were about 42 and 49 pounds \u2014 that's pretty large for even an adult female coyote      After tracking the animals' radio signals for several weeks, one of the collars began transmitting a mortality signal, Kleitch said It was later found cut off and thrown into a ditch We presume the animal was poached, she said      But the other animal is still followed, with the help of Myers' class at the U-M Biological Station, she said      But there is not a scientific consensus that the wolf-coyote coupling occurred long ago and not again A 2012 study of the blood results of the three captured coywolves in northern Michigan concluded their hybridization could have occurred in the Lower Peninsula if a recolonizing wolf encountered a coyote and mated with it in the absence of another wolf with which to breed      Researchers from the U-M biological station last year tracked radio-collared coywolves, and found their range slightly larger than a typical coyote's but less than a wolf's      The idea that the 5% wolf DNA is having this impact on their morphology and ecology should be held up to some rigorous testing, Gehrt said I think it would be more reasonable to presume it's just not going to have that much effect      Despite a belief that coywolves are more likely to take down a deer, Myers said he's not aware of any instances of farmers' cattle or sheep coming under attack in northeast Lower Michigan      We tell people that if it looks like a wolf, treat it like a wolf That means if coyote hunters or trappers think it could

At this writing, the ISEE-3 is 6.28m km from Earth, and only a matter of days remain in which the right combination of maximum thrust, available fuel and orbital mechanics exist to nudge it into a new, stable orbit for its latest incarnation as a research mission The exact details are still to be finalised, but one option is that it will resume its original task of watching the sun The group will be consulting shortly with NASA for its authorisation to proceed for its next thruster firings The old boat has some life in her yet", "summary": "\u2013 A satellite originally launched in 1978 is getting a new lease on life after NASA stopped using it Now, it's once again rolling at its intended speed, the Economist notes, and the team plans to alter its trajectory next week, NBC News reports So what will the experts do with it?

These were just a few of them And I made the choice to accept his controlling behavior, as he\u2019d just left his long-term girlfriend and I assumed that he was going through some serious emotional discomfort This was a huge mistake      Our first convention together, San Diego Comic Con, he instructed me to not leave the hotel room He went to parties by himself and got a famous actress\u2019s number with intention to date her at the same time as me I found out months later, and couldn\u2019t bring myself to say anything because by this time, my self-worth was in the toilet      I was quickly pressured to take an on-camera job at his company I didn\u2019t want (I do not like to work for my significant others), because he insinuated I would be ungrateful to not accept it Scared to upset him, I accepted the job, but I refused payment for my work, feeling uncomfortable about the whole thing (though the lovely folks at his company eventually forced me to take a check) By this time, like I said, I was terrified to piss him off- so I did what he said      How did this happen? At the beginning of our relationship, I was quite ill often due to my diet, something I\u2019ll get to in a bit One night he initiated, and I said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, can we not tonight? I\u2019m feeling really sick.\u201d He responded, \u201cI just want to remind you, the reason my last relationship didn\u2019t work out was because of the lack of sex.\u201d It was a veiled threat I succumbed      Every night, I laid there for him, occasionally in tears He called it \u201cstarfishing\u201d He thought the whole idea was funny To be fair, I did go along with it out of fear of losing him I\u2019m still recovering from being sexually used (not in a super fun way) for three years      The first time I told him I loved him after 6 months of hoping he\u2019d say it first, his response was (and I quote), \u201cI think I love you too, f****t.\u201d      What I wanted was a partner, someone to confide in, someone to share things with, someone who wouldn\u2019t judge me, someone I knew would be there for me What I felt that this man wanted was a woman who would feed him, sleep with him, and go to events with him      I watched and supported him as he grew from a mildly successful podcaster to a powerhouse CEO of his own company He was obsessed with celebrity, being famous, famous people He did not spend any time with people he considered \u201cfriends\u201d, and only really made time for industry people who he considered \u201cworth it\u201d I, myself, had very little personal support, as I\u2019d been alienated from my own friends, other than an occasional party I was obligated to leave early when he decided it was time Sometimes he\u2019d let me go play D&D, but I always had a curfew He would yell in his voicemails at me if I didn\u2019t answer his calls I was expected to follow him everywhere and exist pretty much solely for him, save for a hosting job once in awhile      When cameras were on us? He was a prince Turn them off, he was a nightmare      During all of this I lost myself, both mentally and physically I lost 15 lbs within weeks, started pulling out my hair (and had to get extensions regularly to hide it) I generally stopped speaking unless spoken to while with him, drifting through life like a ghost I would try to sleep in as late as possible so my days were shorter I stopped listening to music entirely I ceased to be I was an ex-person      No one could save me but myself After three years of being snapped/yelled at constantly, very rarely being shown any affection- I finally left him For another man That I had literally just met I was so desperate to be out I just clung on to the first knight in shining armor to show up      Unfortunately, there was a slight crossover: a kiss A kiss I immediately told him about, and he, surprisingly, instantly forgave me Turned a total 180 He begged me not to leave him, even told me he was planning to propose; despite stating previously he had no intention to marry me I knew this all stemmed from his fear of being alone (He actually got engaged very shortly after I left him) so luckily I remained strong in my resolve to leave him, despite my only desire for three years being that he loved me the way I loved him      Because of my leaving him for someone else, he made calls to several companies I received regular work from to get me fired by threatening to never work with them He succeeded I was blacklisted With the assistance of a woman who\u2019d gained my trust and my heart over the past year, he steamrolled my career The woman actively made it her mission to destroy my friendships And she did, because by the time they\u2019d realized she was\u2026 an unreliable source\u2026 the damage had already been done To be fair, in break-ups like this one, some friends will just naturally gravitate towards the person who wields more power (and the ability to employ them), especially in the business I\u2019m in- despite whatever history exists Still, there\u2019s so much more to that woman\u2019s story (including 6 other women whose reputations/careers she attempted to sabotage) but I don\u2019t want to digress too far from my point, which is abusive relationships, not friendships This time in my life was agony      One night, I found myself on top of an overpass, looking down at the 101, at the lowest point in my life I\u2019d lost many of my friends, the woman I\u2019d considered my sister was trying to destroy me and I had no idea why, and the career I\u2019d built from scratch had toppled- I was blacklisted from my industry at the age of 25      Obviously, I didn\u2019t go through with it, but over the years I considered it many times With the help of a therapist, a psychiatrist, good people, plus a lot of hard work, I\u2019ve managed to rebuild my life and I\u2019m in a much better place I\u2019ve got a wonderful group of friends, a healthy career, a film I\u2019m proud of, a show I\u2019m proud of, two wonderful dogs, a house I own, and a bright future (at least, in my eyes)      But I never received closure For the long-lasting trauma, physical and emotional For the time I was screamed at for spilling some bottled water in a rental car For the time I asked him if he \u201cwas okay\u201d one too many times For the time I gasped at a cute puppy and I was punished for startling him For how cold and unkind he was to me 90% of the time For losing the life and friendships I\u2019d built because of his insecurities For blaming me for leaving him when he was never there in the first place, except when he wanted sex      I\u2019ll leave you with this: I lost my period for a year because of anorexia Somehow, I got pregnant ectopically (I was told I\u2019d have to have surgery IMMEDIATELY because ectopic pregnancies are very dangerous and can often be fatal)- when I found out, I collapsed on the floor, terrified he would be furious with me Between sobs I told him over the phone, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be mad, and don\u2019t worry, I have to have surgery to have it removed or it could kill me at any time.\u201d      Let me add here: I\u2019ll never forget the night this man slept in a cot at the foot of my hospital bed after my surgery It made me believe that deep down inside of him maybe there was a man who loved me      \u201cThat\u2019s great When do you think I can have sex with her again?\u201d said my ex      While we were together, he repeatedly shared with me that he was terrified I would talk publicly about how he treated me, but I\u2019m done protecting him at the expense of my own mental health He talked about me publicly, incorrectly speculating loudly and regularly that I was sleeping around on him, on multiple occasions (once in front of an audience of thousands at a convention) It got so bad I ended up having to ask my lawyer to write his a letter Meanwhile, publicly, I continually tried to go high while he went low Also at the time, I knew it was unlikely people would choose to believe me over a cheery-sounding famous guy All it would do to properly come forward was hurt me And guess what? It will probably hurt me now too, despite the #MeToo movement We\u2019ve come a long way, but we still have a ways to go      You know, perhaps this post could be construed as me going low when I should be going high, but I\u2019d like to think Michelle Obama would support me in this\u2026 Because I\u2019m not alone This kind of relationship is so common, and so easy to slip into Normalizing behavior happens incredibly quickly, and one can lose track of what is acceptable treatment      And that\u2019s the big question, isn\u2019t it? If this person treated you so badly why did you stay?      It wasn\u2019t that bad Memories can warp He was famous She enjoyed the lifestyle (For the record, I usually insisted on paying for dinner, thank you very much.) She was dumb and/or weak and didn\u2019t have the strength to stand up to him      Here is my answer: I believed that, to borrow an analogy from a friend, if I kept digging I would find water And sometimes I did Just enough to sustain me And when you\u2019re dying of thirst, that water is the best water you\u2019ll ever drink When you\u2019re alienated from your friends, there\u2019s no one to tell you that there\u2019s a drinking fountain 20 feet away And when your self-worth reaches such depths after years of being treated like you\u2019re worthless, you might find you think you deserve that sort of treatment, and no one else will love you      PS: To the man who tried to ruin my future: A sincere and heartfelt apology could have made my last four years a hell of a lot easier The person I used to date would try to sue me due to pride- I would not recommend it I have audio/video that will support and prove many of the things I\u2019ve stated in this post I\u2019ve chosen not to include it for your sake, in the hopes that the person you\u2019ve become will do the right thing      I had kept the words \u201csexually assault\u201d in my piece since the very first draft Before posting, I got cold feet and was pressured to change it to \u201csexually violate\u201d out of fear of backlash When it posted unlisted, the edit did not save- and I\u2019m grateful it didn\u2019t, because it did not allow me to back away from my original statement When I decided to \u201cpublish\u201d it properly (make it \u201clisted\u201d instead of unlisted), it changed the words back to \u201csexually violate\u201d I immediately went to rectify it as quickly as I could I stand by my statement", "summary": "\"He called it 'starfishing.'

In an open letter posted on Twitter earlier this week, the British songwriter apologized for the delay\u2014she\u2019s now 27, for what it\u2019s worth\u2014and described the emotional thrust behind the record:      My last record was a break-up record and if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record I\u2019m making up with myself Making up for lost time Making up for everything I ever did and never did But I haven\u2019t got time to hold on to the crumbs of my past like I used to What\u2019s done is done Turning 25 was a turning point for me, slap bang in the middle of my twenties Teetering on the edge of being an old adolescent and a fully-fledged adult, I made the decision to go into becoming who I\u2019m going to be forever without a removal van full of my old junk [...] 25 is about getting to know who I\u2019ve become without realising And I\u2019m sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened      \u201cHello\u201d itself is a reminder of exactly why Adele so easily outsells her peers It\u2019s a heart-wrenching ballad about a woman who\u2019s nostalgic for the not-so-distant past: She regrets the way things went down with an ex-lover and wants to apologize, but knows that too much time has passed for her to bother trying to fix it It\u2019s a soulful easy-listening jam with a thunderous hook\u2014a classic Adele sing-along if ever there was one Watch the video, which features Mack Wilds (!!!), below      Adele\u2019s 25 will be released on November 20th on XL/Columbia", "summary": "20: \"The song [is] a heart-wrenching ballad about a woman who's nostalgic for the not-so-distant past,\" writes Puja Patel on The Concourse \"It's soulful, easy-listening with a thunderous hook\u2014a classic Adele sing-along if there ever was one fav if you\u2019re holding it all in, trying to keep yourself together.\" It's not just the song itself winning praise: \"While the video is intimate, it also has an epic feel to it", "summary_all": "\u2013 Adele is out with her first new song in three years, and the Internet is decidedly happy about it Five reactions to \"Hello,\" the first single from Adele's 25, which will be released Nov 20: \"The song [is] a heart-wrenching ballad about a woman who's nostalgic for the not-so-distant past,\" writes Puja Patel on The Concourse \"It's soulful, easy-listening with a thunderous hook\u2014a classic Adele sing-along if there ever was one ..

I was a repeat customer, but now I will NEVER use this service again AND I'll be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau      It's my Third time I am using Franks Express, will never cheat on them, lol Service as usual TOP, guys arrived on time, team is very Friendly as always, this time I moved my office, guys were very professional, what ever problem I faced with this move these people find a great solutions to resolve it, I had a desk that didn't feat and then it was special order, I was very upset that I couldn't place it the way I want( size of desks was wrong) they did literally everything to make me HAPPY, even tho it was totally my mistake, they even helped me to design my place ;)) The price is very reasonable, customer service is very friendly, guys are awesome If u planing to move with no stress, then I highly recommend Franks Express!!!      I used Franks Express a few weeks back during a time that was stressful and our moving details in flux The team of 3 arrived early on a Sunday, right on time, and made quick work once they got started Their estimated costs are more accurate the more information you have to provide In my case, we used most of our own boxes but relied on the movers for padding fragile pieces and plastic wrapping others Keep in mind any material or product you need from the movers will be an extra cost It's reasonable but just keep this in mind when you get an initial quote from them Again, the more info have for them the more accurate their quote will be All in all I'm happy with the service and would recommend this company to others      HORRIBLE MOVING SERVICE First of all, they emailed me an hour and a half before my move and said they had to cancel because their truck broke down I called them and asked if there was anything they can do for me they said no sorry, not our problem Then I scrambled to find new movers for my 2 pm move and called maybe another 30-40 places for a last minute move I finally find someone who is available to move and set the time with them The movers show up around 2 pm and start moving stuff and do not even tell me where they are from so I assumed it was the new movers WRONG! The movers from FRANKS show up even after canceling on me and after me hiring someone new Half of my stuff is already in the truck so I have to call the new movers and cancel on them when they are already outside of my apartment There was an issue with the building and I had to keep my stuff in storage with them for about a week I get back and I schedule a last minute move with them again on Monday and they say it's okay they will be there at 3 pm then they call me at 3 pm and say they cancel and will not be there and they will come the next day after I already have taken off work now I have to take off again They come drop my stuff off while I have to wait In their truck for 3 hours in the heat They leave all of the boxes in the living room and I have to move them myself to the bedroom This I wasn't even able to check because they wanted me to pay them and leave ALSO THEY GAVE ME SOMEONE ELSE'S STUFF WITH THEIR PASSPORTS AND CHECKBOOK INSIDE!!! I email Sophie who is the worst of all, and let her know they left someone's box in my apartment I told them I will be at work late and I will not be home for awhile and they REPEATEDLY CALL ME 15 times that day One guy also texted me and called me to say I WILL WAIT OUTSIDE YOUR APARTMENT FOR YOU UNTIL YOU GET HOME I tell them I am working late and we can schedule a time I tried to leave the box with the mailroom and they said no so I left work and came back to do this for them and they said they would compensate me and NOTHING The guy who came to pick up the box AN HOUR LATE looks at me and said is there something you wanted?? I have never been harassed this much in my life They are very selfish movers and are horrible and always LATE!      I spoke with Tatania at Frank's moving, and she was quite helpful in getting me situated for a move I am currently Living in North Carolina my son lives in New York City He wanted to take some possessions out of our storage unit which could have been a little chaotic But, with her help and scheduling, it all went quite well The movers did a good job, and I would definitely recommend this service      Overall good job with the move, however, customer service was so terrible that it was really worth docking 3 stars over The move started and ended well It was done in good time I even walked a few blocks to the ATM because the guys said they preferred cash and tipped them $50 At the end of the move the guys told me they brought everything up and I trusted that Maybe it is my fault for not checking to make sure every item was there But afterwards while I was unpacking I noticed I was missing 1 bag This was a white garbage bag so I figured maybe they thought it was trash in the truck I reached out plenty of times to the woman I was corresponding with over email and finally got a call about a week later The call was unproductive The man on the phone tells me that his guys remember putting the bag in my apartment and that I probably didn't lock the door and let someone steal it How is this an appropriate thing to say? I'm fully aware of who comes in my apartment and no one is coming in to steal a white garbage bag full of pillows over a 50'' flat screen TV anyways He said there was nothing they could do for me and that if I left a bad review that they would sue me for slander I guess he isn't aware that in order to be sued for slander you have to be lying? Nonetheless, I understand if you can't find my belongings (especially after a week) but to threaten me with court proceedings and not try to remedy the situation is a little much And yes, you may think all this for pillows? Well, it happened to be pillows with 1 of 2 pillow cases for multiple sheet sets and a duvet So now I have to buy new pillows, sheet sets, set of decorative pillows and a duvet Blown      Absolutely fantastic! The team moved quickly, wasting no time They had a spare bag of tools to help with things that I had not been prepared for They took apart a desk and put it back together upon arrival, I didn't even have to ask It was a tough job, 4 flight walkup in manhattan with very heavy objects including treadmills These guys are pros, and super friendly and fun to boot Super impressed they found parking for the truck, they can navigate that thing anywhere They even gave me a ride! Above and beyond service, at a great price      I did a move yesterday 4/30 and I must say I can't more pleased with my service! It was super cheap to me and well worth the $50 tip that I added on the service Mike and his partner were super efficient with their time and moving my items The wrapped all necessary items with no complaints and did an excellent job with handling everything with care They even let me ride in the truck which I appreciate so much bc I did not want to call an Uber Also, I booked 2 days before and was able to get a spot confirmed plus they arrived early! Thanks so much Mike and Franks express for your amazing service!      I did my move on 4/18/17 and I am more than satisfied with the work the three men did on my move from storage in Brooklyn, NY to my new place in Manhattan They arrived on time after I just had another moving company cancel on me at the very last minute They were able to take care of my move the same day (just wished I would've been able to complete the move before rush hour traffic set in) Just a sidebar, if you can avoid doing your move between 3 & 4 please do because it doesn't leave room to beat rush hour traffic at all Anyway, the 3 men were professional and worked non-stop I felt for them because I had a walk up and 2 flights of stairs with very heavy boxes They didn't complain at all still did there job and even the unloading didn't take as long as I had expected being they had to go back and forth up steps Though if I had 4 movers it would've went a bit quicker but again I can't complain I only did what I could afford to do I moved a small 5x10 unit and they were able to load the truck just under hour and a half time if it wasn't for traffic I would've probably been just under $400 for the move but I can't complain I still got a great rate even with being stuck in traffic Thank you Franks Express Movers you exceeded my expectations I highly recommended them if you need to hire a professional moving company      These owners are thieves The actual workers are kind and great This company doesn't know how to articulate and specify their fees They leave it at the time of payment to over charge the individual I had a fridge move from one garage to another within 28 minutes drive from each other, total move time was 54 minutes This company wanted me to pay $330 (2 hours for moving and 1 hour travel time) No where in the email estimate was it written minimum estimate of $330 It even said, Please be advised that the estimate above is not a flat rate I was under the impression it could be less and the max $330 The owner/boss gets on the phone and tries to sweet talk me into paying telling me that you knew the estimate was the minimum I explained that nowhere in the writing was that word written there I refuse to pay for time that wasn't used And if it was I could have hired friends or workers and rented a uhaul rather then hiring your services I told him he could take me to court I'm only paying what's fair He threatened me with the cops I agreed to calling the cops Cops came and settled the matter and advised me to go to court Watch out for this company It's unfortunate, because the workers were great In response to the company's reply....

After Baghdadi\u2019s appointment, ISI\u2019s inner circle closed ranks around its chosen leader It discontinued all but the most cursory communication with al-Qaida central, and slowly, the few remaining senior figures considered loyal to Zawahiri were either deliberately sidelined or killed off on the battlefield By the time Zawahiri\u2019s fateful letter arrived in May 2013, Raheem said, there was not a single person in Isis\u2019s senior leadership who had once belonged to al-Qaida      In December 2013, Hussein Suleiman, a handsome young physician who was also a senior officer of the Islamic Front rebel group, was sent to make peace with a local Isis unit after trouble broke out at a checkpoint near Lake Assad in eastern Syria When Suleiman did not return to base, Islamic Front officials contacted Isis, which confirmed they were holding him prisoner as a spy Outraged, the Islamic Front demanded his release Surely Isis could not go around arresting peace brokers? At the very least, they asked that his crimes be tried in an independent sharia court Isis refused      Using intermediaries to keep Zawahiri informed of his attempts at arbitration, Maqdisi reached out to Isis\u2019s inner circle in late 2013, approaching one of his former students, a young Bahraini named Turki Binali Binali had been his protege \u2013 a pupil of \u201cextraordinary passion\u201d, in Maqdisi\u2019s words Some nicknamed him \u201cMaqdisi junior\u201d After joining Isis, Binali rapidly rose into its highest ranks: he was appointed as Baghdadi\u2019s official biographer, and by spring 2014, he had been named Isis\u2019s chief \u201cscholar at arms\u201d In theory, a single decree from Binali\u2019s pen could end the civil war between Isis and al-Qaida      This was a serious threat to Isis\u2019s legitimacy, and even its future According to a series of detailed leaks from an anonymous Twitter account \u2013 much of which the Guardian has subsequently verified \u2013 Binali approached Baghdadi with a stark appraisal of Isis\u2019s vulnerable position The caliphate would eventually collapse, he said, if the jihad\u2019s leading scholars and veterans continued to stand against Isis The project could not be sustained unless Isis recruited influential supporters      Communicating primarily via Telegram messenger, an app that allows for encrypted communications, Maqdisi sent word to Isis in January of this year that the Jordanians would be willing to conduct a prisoner swap: in return for the pilot, they would release a woman named Sajida al-Rishawi In 2005, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had sent al-Rishawi and her husband on a mission to Jordan, where they were to explode bomb belts at the Radisson SAS hotel as part of a coordinated series of suicide bombings Rishawi\u2019s device did not detonate, and she was arrested, languishing on death row for the next decade In his approach to Isis, Maqdisi said, he reminded the group\u2019s senior leaders that, as the inheritors of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi\u2019s legacy, they had an obligation to save her now      On 3 February, after a few days of tense dialogue, the negotiators finally sent Maqdisi the password to unlock the file When he received it, Maqdisi realised he had been betrayed: the password, in Arabic, was \u201cMaqdisi the pimp, the sole of the tyrant\u2019s shoe, son of the English whore.\u201d      After he typed it in, one humiliating character at a time, a video appeared on Maqdisi\u2019s screen He watched in horror as Isis soldiers muscled the pilot into a cage, doused him in petrol, and burned him alive Three hours later, Isis posted the video on the internet The next day, Sajida al-Rishawi was taken from her cell and executed      At his house on the outskirts of Zarqa, about 25km from Amman, Maqdisi keeps a large model boat on top of one of his overstuffed bookshelves It\u2019s a strange object to find there: Islamic extremists are not known for their maritime collectibles The boat was a gift from a very senior member of Isis, who built it from pencils and matchsticks while incarcerated in Abu Ghraib Above the boat\u2019s sails hangs a banner that reads \u201cJourney with us,\u201d a quotation from the Quranic retelling of the story of the flood, when Noah reaches out to beckon his son aboard For Maqdisi, it is a symbol of salvation and unity \u201cIt\u2019s meant as a message for all Muslims,\u201d he said \u2013 one with a special significance for jihadis today, as the factional bloodshed rages on      Facebook Twitter Pinterest

\u201cspite\u201d rather than \u201cempowering believers\u201d Even the attacks of 9/11, Maqdisi said, were part of a misguided strategy \u201cThe actions in New York and Washington, no matter how

meant to be a cornerstone of the resort here      Gerd Grochowiak, managing director of one of the site\u2019s developers, Irisgerd real estate, dismissed critics of the site\u2019s redevelopment,

operations for the spy agency      Several former intelligence officials described the attack in Afghanistan as devastating to the agency A number of the officers killed had been counterterrorism operatives since before the 9/11 attacks The base played a critical role in the CIA's significant operations in the country, including helping with drone attacks and informant networks in Pakistan      The loss of seven officers is significant for a relatively small agency whose workforce is estimated to be 10,000 or more, but it's all the more damaging because those lost represented so much collective experience      The number of casualties in Wednesday's attack was second to those sustained in the Beirut embassy bombing in 1983, which killed eight CIA officers The Beirut bombing hit the agency's Middle East group hard, and was one of the key events that drove the creation of the CIA's Counterterrorist Center a few years later      It could also sow mistrust between CIA officers and the Afghan operatives with whom they work closely, another former agency officer said This is a huge blow to the agency It's a close-knit group, the former officer said They're not going to know who to trust now      The base was located in Khost province, a hotbed of militant activity and a stronghold of the Haqqani Network, one of the most hardened and dangerous militant groups, which fought for a decade to wrest the area back from the Russians      The CIA's Khost base was established in the months after the 9/11 attacks as the U.S launched its CIA-led offensive against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan It began as a makeshift center for CIA-Afghan operations By mid-2002, it had grown into a major counterterrorism hub for joint operations with CIA, military Special

Dan Quayle It's an odd assemblage, linked only by the ill-fated and often unlikable members of the Snyder clan, founders of a string of West Coast hamburger restaurants known as In-N-Out Burger And since Ms Perman's overcooked book means to celebrate the Snyders and their company as a testament to old-fashioned values    reminiscent of a simpler time when people, loyalty, and a freshly-made juicy hamburger meant something, she's in a bit of a pickle      Harry Snyder's dream was a modest one, Ms Perman writes, by way of introduction He was going to start his own little food business -- a hamburger stand And we're off The year is 1948 The place, Baldwin Park, 17 miles east of Los Angeles Our budding mogul is a 35-year-old first-generation American, a veteran and a newlywed Harry and Esther gin up $5,000, buy a small lot fronting what is soon to be a major artery between L.A and Palm Springs, and begin selling burgers for a quarter and soft drinks for a dime      Good timing Tender shoots of fresh highway crisscross California, cars are plentiful and cheap, and the family meal has already begun its migration from dinner table to dashboard Harry sticks a microphone and speaker on a pole, strings a wire from the lot to the grill, and rides the car-hop wave By the book's end, In-N-Out is pulling down $450 million in annual sales We're getting ahead of the story, though      In-N-Out Burger      Ah, but our tale is not, though it unfolds in a way that Ms Perman cannot soon control She wants us to admire the chain and its plucky founder, \u00e0 la Sam Walton, but the company benefits mostly from blind luck, and her protagonist is a bit of a martinet Fearful of debt, Harry Snyder expands on the pay-as-you-go plan As it happens, such flintiness serves the company well It never overreaches, never over-extends While Ray Kroc (McDonald's) and Carl Karcher (Carl's Jr.) attach franchise-fueled booster rockets to their fast-food businesses, Ma and Pa Snyder take it slow and steady, one or two million in sales at a time The relative scarcity of their burgers only adds to the appeal, and the chain gains a mystique      Rich's reign lasts 74 pages Not much of a tinkerer, he leaves untouched most of his father's less-is-more business practices, except for an unconsummated flirtation with a chicken sandwich Learning of the plan, Guy went ballistic, according to a friend He was not going to go for that at all      Crisis averted, Rich devotes his energy to buffing his conservative bona fides He gives hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party and adds The Best Enterprise is a Free Enterprise 'God Bless America'  to In-N-Out stationery He prints Bible verses on the chain's soda cups and signs off on In-N-Out radio spots that ask listeners to let Jesus into their lives Confronted with the inevitable complaints, Rich snaps: Well, that's too bad This is God's company, not mine Soon he's supping at the White House, eating roast loin of veal with Dan Quayle He marries a woman 14 years his junior, builds a mansion and, then, rather abruptly, dies in a plane crash At the funeral, hamburgers are served      It's now 1993 Enter Guy Snyder Awkward, also portly, and prone to substance abuse, he is not an ideal chief executive for a company now generating $133 million in sales Before long Guy is shooting heroin, sending a company executive into Mexico to smuggle drugs, and getting busted (on Christmas Day) with a briefcase stuffed with pot, Valium, Klonopin, a 9mm Glock, a switchblade and $27,475 in cash Poor Ms Perman does her darnedest to put a sunny spin on things It was due in no small part to the talented and loyal executive team that In-N-Out Burger remained on a stable and successful course No doubt      Then, rather abruptly, Esther dies in 2006, leaving Guy's 24-year-old daughter to inherit the company (now worth almost half a billion dollars) With only a high-school education and an affinity for joining off-beat Christian sects, Lynsi Martinez lacks sufficient personal maturity, experience, and skill necessary to successfully run In-N-Out, or so testifies an In-N-Out board member No

\u201cIn-N-Out Burger is a private company and this valuation of the company is nothing more than speculation based on estimates from people with no knowledge of In-N-Out\u2019s financials, which are and always have been private,\u201d Carl Van Fleet, the company\u2019s vice president of planning and development, said in an e-mailed statement      Torres\u2019s father, Harry Guy Snyder, became chief executive following Rich\u2019s 1993 death in a plane crash at age 41 The chain expanded to 140 locations under Guy, who inherited his father\u2019s passion for drag racing      When he died of a prescription drug overdose at age 49 in 1999, Snyder\u2019s estate included 27 cars and other vehicles, including a 1965 Ford Cobra and a pair of 1960\u2019s-era Dodge Dart muscle cars, according to his will      \u201cI have no clue about her,\u201d said Janet Lowder, a Rancho Palos Verdes, California, restaurant consultant, who said she was one of the few people to extract the company\u2019s

very quiet That\u2019s their culture.\u201d      Torres has little formal management training and no college degree The company was structured to carry on after the demise of its founders, according to a 2003 Harvard Business School case study In-N-Out has never franchised to outside operators, the Harvard researchers said, giving up a low-cost revenue stream in exchange for maintaining quality control      In-N-Out expanded to Texas in 2011, after building a warehouse and the patty facility There are now 16 units in the state Conrad Lyon, a Los Angeles-based senior restaurants analyst for B Riley Caris, said additional expansion will continue to be gradual      \u201cI would expect slow, calculated growth,\u201d he said in a phone interview \u201cTo outsiders the company\u2019s growth out West likely appears sluggish However, it was management carefully leveraging its brand, real estate and distribution As a private company-owned system, In-N-Out has the luxury of calling the shots to replicate its success without succumbing to potentially detrimental outside influences.\u201d      The company\u2019s pace of expansion was one of the issues at stake in an exchange of lawsuits in 2006 between Torres, In-N- Out executives and Richard Boyd, the company\u2019s former vice president of real estate and development Boyd was one of two trustees overseeing the trust that controls the company\u2019s stock on behalf of Torres      Among other allegations filed in California state court in Los Angeles, Boyd claimed Torres and Mark Taylor -- her brother- in-law from a half-sister -- conspired to remove Esther Snyder from the company to gain control of In-N-Out He filed a separate petition with the probate court seeking to prevent Torres from removing him as a trustee      Torres denied the allegations in both a formal answer to Boyd\u2019s complaint and a 2006 letter to the editor published in the Los Angeles Times, in which she said she only had \u201cminimal involvement\u201d in the company\u2019s business decisions, and didn\u2019t favor rapid expansion      The company in turn filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Boyd, alleging fraud and embezzlement in connection to Boyd\u2019s relationship to one of In-N-Out\u2019s outside construction firms Boyd\u2019s lawyer, Philip Heller of Fagelbaum & Heller LLP in Los Angeles, said all the litigation was dismissed following a confidential settlement Boyd resigned from the company and the trust      Since then, Torres has refused most interview requests, even by author Stacy Perman, who wrote a 352-page book about In- N-Out in 2009 Torres asked to set up a meeting with the author after the book\u2019s publication, but it never occurred, Perman wrote in an afterword to the 2010 paperback edition      Torres popped up in real-estate blogs in September, after buying a $17.4 million, 16,600-square-foot mansion in the wealthy enclave of Bradbury, California, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains A Realtor.com listing for the house described it as having seven bedrooms, 16 bathrooms, a pool, a tennis court and other amenities      Like Camargo and Marshall, Torres maintains a low profile Her most visible presence has been on the drag strip She competes in the National Hot Rod Association\u2019s Super Gas and Top Sportsman Division 7 categories, alternating between a 1970 Plymouth Barracuda and a 1984 Chevrolet Camaro, according to NHRA results Her third husband, Val Torres Jr., is also a race- car driver      She also inherited her Uncle Rich\u2019s interest in religion, funding a non-profit organization called Healing Hearts & Nations that proselytizes in Africa, according to a 2010 Form 990 foundation filing that lists Torres as the chief financial officer Former In-N-Out executive Boyd alleged in his 2006 cross-complaint against the company that Torres attempted to fire him because he was not a \u201cman of God,\u201d and because he didn\u2019t attend prayer meetings at her home She denied Boyd\u2019s claims in the company\u2019s answer      \u201cIt\u2019s an open question whether she may have different feelings later,\u201d said Gordon \u201cLike most kids, or second or third generations of a very wealthy family, I don\u2019t know that she has restaurant blood in her veins, or if she\u2019s a trust fund baby.\u201d

From what I hear, other people had similar experiences In fact, many volunteers never received their packets at all      At 6:30AM on Tuesday, I went to the polls I was immediately turned away because I didn't have my poll watcher certificate Many, many people had this problem The impression I got was this was taken care of because they had registered me Others were as well But apparently, I was supposed to go on my own to a Victory Center to pick it up, but that was never communicated properly Outside of the technical problems, this was the single biggest failure of the operation They simply didn't inform people that this was a requirement In fact, check out my checklist from my ORCA packet:      So, I headed back home to see if I could get my certificate I called their official help line It went unanswered I tried their legal line Same thing I emailed them No response I continued to do this for six straight hours and never got a response I even tried to call three local victory centers All went straight to voicemail      While I was home, I took to Twitter and the web to try to find some answers From what I saw, these problems were widespread People had been kicked from poll watching for having no certificate Others never received their pdf packets Some were sent the wrong packets from a different area Some received their packet, but their usernames and passwords didn't work      Now a note about the technology itself For starters, this was billed as an app when it was actually a mobile-optimized website (or web app) For days I saw people on Twitter saying they couldn't find the app on the Android Market or iTunes and couldn't download it Well, that's because it didn't exist It was a website This created a ton of confusion Not to mention that they didn't even turn it on until 6AM in the morning, so people couldn't properly familiarize themselves with how it worked on their personal phone beforehand      Next, and this part I find mind-boggingly absurd, the web address was located at https://www.whateveritwas.com/orca Notice the s after http This denotes it's a secure connection, something that's used for e-commerce and web-based email So far, so good The problem is that they didn't auto-forward the regular http to https and as a result, many people got a blank page and thought the system was down Setting up forwarding is the simplest thing in the world and only takes seconds, but they failed to do it This is compounded by the fact that mobile browsers default to http when you just start with www (as 95% of the world does)      By 2PM, I had completely given up I finally got ahold of someone at around 1PM and I never heard back From what I understand, the entire system crashed at around 4PM I'm not sure if that's true, but it wouldn't surprise me I decided to wait for my wife to get home from work to vote, which meant going very late (around 6:15PM) Here's the kicker, I never got a call to go out and vote So, who the hell knows if that end of it was working either      The bitter irony of this entire endeavor was that a supposedly small government candidate gutted the local structure of GOTV efforts in favor of a centralized, faceless organization in a far off place (in this case, their Boston headquarters) Wrap your head around that      I'm on Twitter at @JohnEkdahl if you have any questions", "summary": "Crucial information was never communicated, leaving Ekdahl unable to even watch the polls Breitbart.com has a number of similar reports from other volunteers", "summary_all": "\u2013 Before election day, the Romney campaign was touting something it called \"Project ORCA,\" an app that was supposed to revolutionize and digitize the GOP's get-out-the vote efforts How did it work out?

Shall we start playing with EICAS messages? 'PASS OXYGEN ON' Anyone? He punctuated the tweet with a smiley face      The tweet was meant as a sarcastic joke; a reference to how he had tried for years to get Boeing and Airbus to heed warnings about security issues with their passenger communications systems His tweet about the Engine Indicator Crew Alert System, or EICAS, was a reference to research he'd done years ago on vulnerabilities in inflight infotainment networks, vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to access cabin controls and deploy a plane's oxygen masks      The outer cover of the box was open approximately 1/2 inch and one of the retaining screws was not seated and was exposed, FBI Special Agent Hurley wrote in his affidavit      When asked by WIRED if he ever connected his laptop to the SEB on his flight from Denver to Chicago, Roberts said, Nope I did not That I\u2019m happy to say and I\u2019ll stand from the top of the tallest tower and yell that one      He also questions the FBI's assessment that the boxes showed signs of tampering      Regardless of whether the authorities have a case against him, however, there has already been some fallout from the incident Roberts told WIRED that today investors on the board of directors of One World Labs, a company he helped found, decided to withdraw their investments in the company As a result, One World Labs had to lay off about a dozen employees today, half of its staff", "summary": "\u2013 Can a passenger with a laptop really electronically hijack a plane via its in-flight entertainment system?

{"article_number": 3209, "article_idx": 1, "article_text": "Sina Weibo maintains a ban on searches for Liu Xiaobo\u2019s name in English and Chinese (both simplified and traditional) However, since his passing, his given name (Xiaobo) alone is enough to trigger censorship, showing increased censorship on the platform and a recognition that his passing is a particularly sensitive event      Liu Xiaobo\u2019s death is a politically sensitive event for the CPC The 1989 Tiananmen Square student protests grew out of a public mourning of Hu Yaobang after his death Hu was a popular political figure who advocated for market and political reform, including for greater government transparency Like Hu, Liu was a popular symbol of political reform and freedom, and his death could potentially rally the public to mourn or cause embarrassment to the authorities      WeChat can censor a message based on whether it contains a blacklisted keyword combination A keyword combination consists of one or more keyword components When a keyword combination consists of only one component (e.g., \u201c\u5289\u66c9\u6ce2\u201d), then a message is filtered if it contains that component For a keyword combination that contains more than one component (e.g., \u201c\u5218\u6653\u6ce2\u201d and \u201c\u4e60\u8fd1\u5e73\u201d), a message is censored only if every component in the combination appears somewhere in the message, although not necessarily adjacently In this case censorship rules may be implemented more precisely      WeChat performs censorship on the server-side, which means that messages pass through a WeChat server that contains rules for implementing censorship If the message includes a keyword combination that has been targeted for blocking, the entire message will not be received Documenting censorship on a system with a server-side implementation requires devising a message of one or more keywords to test, running that message through the app, and recording the results      Keyword-based Censorship Before Liu Xiaobo\u2019s Death      Between July 1 2016 to July 11 2017 we found 30 keyword combinations censored All 30 combinations were found blocked in group chat with 19 of these also blocked on one-to-one chat (See Table 1)      Language Group Chat One-to-one chat Simplified Chinese 30 19 Table 1: Number of keyword combinations found blocked before Liu Xiaobo\u2019s death      Keyword combinations censored prior to the announcement of Liu Xiaobo\u2019s cancer diagnosis focused on his advocacy legacy (see Table 2)      Keyword-based Censorship After

Xiaobo\u2019s death      The content of the keyword combinations blocked after Liu Xiaobo\u2019s death are much broader in scope Blocked combinations included general references to his death (e.g., \u201c\u6653\u6ce2\u201d + \u201c\u53bb\u4e16\u201d, Xiaobo + died) and even his name alone, effectively censoring any messages on WeChat that reference him      Figure 1 WeChat censors messages containing \u201c\u5218\u6653\u6ce2\u201d and \u201cLiu Xiaobo\u201d in group chat      Our previous research shows that image censorship occurs in both WeChat\u2019s chat function and WeChat Moments      Following Liu Xiaobo\u2019s death we found that WeChat filters images related to him on both chat functions (i.e., one-to-one chat and group chat), as well as on WeChat Moments This event is the first time we have documented image filtering on WeChat\u2019s one-to-one chat function, showing that the censorship over the Liu Xiaobo event is more extensive than WeChat image censorship we previously documented      Figure 3 Evidence of image censorship in WeChat Moments A user with an international account (on the left) posts an image of Liu Xiaobo, which is hidden from the Moment\u2019s feed of user with China account (on the right)      Figure 4 Evidence of image censorship in WeChat one-to-one chat A user with an international account (on the left) attempts to send an image of a cartoon of an empty chair symbolizing Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo to an account linked to a mainland Chinese phone number The image is not received by the China account user      Figure 5 Evidence of image censorship on WeChat\u2019s group chat A user with an international account attempts to send an image commemorating Liu Xiaobo\u2019s death in a group chat Users with China accounts in the group did not receive the message      Figure 6 Image of books on \u201cCharter 08\u201d and a Biography of Liu Xiaobo, which are both banned in mainland China The image was not blocked on WeChat      Figure 7 Screenshot of the official announcement of Liu Xiaobo\u2019s death issued by The Bureau of Justice in Shenyang city The image was censored on both group chat and WeChat Moments      Weibo allows users to search the entire platform for relevant posts Past research has found that search results are heavily filtered We confirm through testing done after Liu\u2019s death that there is a blanket block on any search terms containing Liu Xiaobo\u2019s name in English, simplified Chinese, and traditional Chinese This search blocking does not seem to be a reaction to Liu Xiaobo\u2019s recent illness or death as his name has been fairly consistently blocked on Weibo search in recent years      Weibo\u2019s more restrictive baseline as compared to WeChat may allow for a more seamless user experience during moments of particular sensitivity Users may not be upset if they cannot find content related to sensitive events if they have been normalized to a certain level of censorship on a platform And yet, despite years of becoming accustomed to censorship, we still see examples of Weibo users similarly complaining (see Figure 8) about how their posts have been censored and how they are being restricted from searching for any content using Liu\u2019s proper name      Figure 8: A Sina Weibo User posts a screenshot with a comment: \u201cThis is also forbidden? \ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37\u201d Translation of the text in the screenshot which the user attempted to post before getting a \u201ccontent is illegal!\u201d error, from top to bottom: 1) I have no enemies 2) Candle 3) Trying this one, Liu Xiaobo (alternative characters) is dead      Figure 9: Left: A search for \u201cliuxiaob\u201d recommends search terms like \u201c\u5218\u5c0fbo\u201d Right: A search for \u201cliver cancer\u201d returns \u201cliver cancer Liu\u201d as a suggested keyword      With Liu\u2019s passing, we experimented with whether this method might produce relevant results We took nine Liu Xiaobo related keywords (code for the keyword extraction and testing; Google Sheet of results) and ran them through the suggested keywords API returning 201 keywords Not all of these keywords were relevant to Liu but others were and included sensitive topics (e.g., references to Liu and liver cancer, and homophones of Liu\u2019s name)      None of the suggested keywords in our testing sample were censored The specific algorithm that drives how these keywords are suggested is unclear, but a preliminary results shows a number of interesting traits      If the blanket ban of Liu Xiaobo is a reaction to this particular sensitive moment in time, is it possible that discussion of Liu Xiaobo will open up again after a certain period, or will he remain blocked forever, erased from history? Will the Chinese people know or remember who is Liu Xiaobo? In comparison, there are signs that the Chinese, especially the younger generation, are already slowly forgetting about the 1989 Tiananmen Square student protests Continued monitoring of social media in China is necessary to assess if Liu Xiaobo\u2019s death will act as a momentary spike in censorship or the beginning of a sustained effort to wipe him into a collective amnesia      Appendix A: WeChat Testing News Sources", "summary": "", "summary_all": "\u2013 Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo's supporters say that in casting his ashes into the sea, the Chinese government hoped to deprive them of a permanent resting place to hold dear What it did instead was create the world's biggest memorial, say those supporters, who plan to gather next to and even in the ocean Wednesday\u2014the seventh day since Liu's death from multiple organ failure related to cancer at age 61\u2014as part of a staging of memorials around the planet The effort will follow water-minding acts and protests that have already occurred in New York, Boston, Melbourne, London, and Hong Kong \"The whole sea has become a place where we can be close to him,\" a friend tells the Guardian Beijing's idea \"backfired,\" adds another activist \"Now anyone can go to the sea and mourn.\" A report from the Canada-based Citizen Lab picked up by Quartz sees Beijing's hand in something else: It found that when users of Wechat\u2014China's most popular messaging app\u2014attempted to message an image of Liu to another user, the image was scrubbed and never made it to the intended recipient (The dying Nobel Prize winner's last words were for his wife.)"}

subsequently apologized for the myriad billing and service problems but maintains it did not intend to have O\u2019Rourke fired, but that has not satisfied Conal, who has filed a lawsuit against the nation\u2019s largest cable company, alleging violations of, among other claims, a federal law prohibiting cable companies from sharing personal information without customers\u2019 consent      The

PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which earns a significant amount of revenue (at least $30 million annually, according to the complaint) as a consultant to Comcast      \u201cMr O\u2019Rourke believes that the

complaint      The call from Mr Salva \u2014 who is also named as a defendant in the suit \u2014 to a PwC executive resulted in Conal being subjected to an ethics investigation, which Conal claims consisted solely of a 20-minute phone interview      \u201cDefendant Salva either directly asked for Mr O\u2019Rourke\u2019s termination, or implicitly requested and caused it by making the knowingly false, defamatory, and malicious accusation that Mr O\u2019Rourke had violated accounting ethics rules by attempting to use his employment with PWC as leverage in his \u2018negotiations\u2019 with

{"article_number": 105, "article_idx": 2, "article_text": "(CNN) Debris found in the western Indian Ocean on Wednesday appears to be part of a Boeing 777, the same model as Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that disappeared in 2014, according to a source close to the investigation      The source said there is a unique element to the Boeing 777's flaperon, a wing component, that Boeing observers believe they are seeing in photos      The debris was found off the coast of St Andre, a community on the island, according to Adjutant Christian Retournat      Police carry a piece of debris from an unidentified aircraft found off the coast of Reunion island      K.S Narendran, whose wife was on the plane, said he was reticent to call the discovery a major development      I think this is very early days yet All we know is that a small part has been found It is still a little early to suggest it does belong to MH370, he told CNN's Erin Burnett OutFront from India I think it is premature to feel that it is all coming to a close or that we are even closer to the truth      If ultimately this is the piece of the wing, then that little thread of hope that I have been holding on to will, will have to break And reality will have to take over, she said holding back tears But, yeah, up until now, I and most of the family members have continued to believe that until we have a body .. we can't give up hoping they will still come back      CNN analysts said there are indications the airplane part could be from a Boeing 777, and if that's the case, it's likely from MH370      This means crash investigators may be able to figure it out from photographs of the part, which could be an aileron, a flap or a flaperon, even before arriving on the island, he said      Airplane debris is being examined to see if it's connected to MH370      This is from a sudden impact, it looks like to me, Soucie said      There also is a seal on the top of the part that is consistent with what I would see on an inside flap on a triple 7, he said, and the barnacles on the part are consistent with the parasitic activity that would take place from being underwater so long      If it is a part from a triple 7, we can be fairly confident it is from 370 because there just haven't been that many triple 7 crashes and there haven't been any in this area, said CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo      Reporters from Antenne Reunion looked at the debris, which Forestier said was about 2 meters by 1 meter (6.5 feet by 3 feet)      There was a marking BB670 on the part      Soucie said he believes the number is a part number, though it might be from a subcontractor      Dolan would not say how likely it was that any debris would move in a westerly direction      There's a range of possibilities, he said It's not an exact science Dolan said surface currents, wind direction and how high an object was floating in the water might all play a role      Photos: The search for MH370
