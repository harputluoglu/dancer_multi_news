Some 69% of those polled believe the US shouldn't be fighting in Afghanistan, up from 53% just four months ago NATO plans to hand over security to Afghan forces by the end of 2014 But 47% of those polled want the US to leave the country ahead of schedule, and only 17% believe the US should stay for as long as it takes to stabilize the country A military expert at the Brookings Institution blames the poll numbers on a lack of awareness of the US policy of slowly turning parts of the country over to Afghan forces "The overall image of this war is of US troops mired in quicksand and getting blown up, and arbitrarily waiting until 2014 to come home," he says "Of course youâ€™d be against it."
