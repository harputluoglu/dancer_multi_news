Maggs and current sheriff Lenny Grankow were the only two people running for the role, meaning the victory ensures Maggs will become sheriff in January Maggs, who received 73% of the vote, says the sheriff called him in for a meeting Tuesday and handed him a letter of termination a minute after polls closed "As of this moment you are no longer an employee of Bon Homme County," the letter stated, ordering Maggs to turn in county-owned equipment by 5pm the next day "It hit her hard," he says Maggs ran for sheriff on a platform of getting tough on drugs, getting more involved with local youth, and delivering better service The former deputy says he's glad people are speaking out, but he would like supporters to stop calling the sheriff's office because "those guys still have a job to do."
