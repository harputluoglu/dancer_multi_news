The Economist reports this kind of interbreeding usually produces offspring that fail to thrive Bigger, stronger, and faster than the typical coyote, the coywolf is comfortable hunting in forests like a wolf as well as in open areas like a coyote One scientist who studied 437 coywolves found they contain 65% coyote DNA, 25% wolf DNA, and 10% dog DNA It's that dog DNA that is helping the coywolf thrive, even in urban areas like New York and Boston, the Economist reports They eat both produce and pets, look before crossing the street, and have even become nocturnal to adapt to urban living Their unique mix of genetics is allowing them to succeed where both wolves and coyotes have failed "They are eastern coyotes," one coyote expert, who doesn't like the term coywolf, told the Detroit Free Press earlier this year "They aren't really different from other coyotes."
