They also have a retro health factor, with approximately double the fat and calories of a normal Twinkie But CNN quotes a Walmart executive who says they're "so good they're worth the calories." Deep-fried Twinkies, which have been a staple at state fairs for years, will be Hostess' first entry into frozen foods.
