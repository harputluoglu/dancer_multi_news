â€“ A new study suggests that heavy drinking raises a person's risk for dementia, especially the early-onset variety Of 57,000 cases, 38% were "alcohol related by definition" and another 18% featured an additional diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, per the Guardian "Thus, screening for heavy drinking should be part of regular medical care." The WHO defines chronic heavy drinking as roughly four to five drinks a day for a man and about three for a woman, per Science Daily And while the study focused on heavy drinking, the results raise questions for those who indulge in more moderate fashion as well, notes the Guardian "What is most surprising about this paper is that it has taken us so long to recognize that alcohol misuse and dependence are such potent risk factors for the development of dementia," says Robert Howard of University College London
