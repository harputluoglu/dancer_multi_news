– A file containing all of WikiLeaks’ 251,000 US State Department cables has—wait for it—leaked online, this time without the names of US sources redacted, meaning many of them could be in danger The file leaked out thanks to some misunderstandings, some carelessness, and the feud between Julian Assange and former spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg, Der Spiegel reports When Domscheit-Berg left WikiLeaks in September 2010, he took the server containing the encrypted file of the original cables with him Even then it was still encrypted and hidden—until this spring, when an Assange contact revealed the password publicly, unaware it would allow access to the cables
