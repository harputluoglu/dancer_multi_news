– Centuries ago, bulls, rams, and other animals led into an ancient cave for religious ceremonies died of seemingly mystical causes, while the priests accompanying them suffered no such fate A study in Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences reveals that the cave located in modern Turkey, which was rediscovered in 2013, sits over a fissure that releases the gas IFLScience explains that the old-time priests likely understood that concentrations were diluted during the daytime by sunlight and wind—and so they held sacrifices before dawn for a quicker kill—and were also smart enough to climb up on stones around the doomed animals to show off their supposed powers "At this height they could stand for 20 [to] 40 minutes without being endangered," Pfanz says Without the stones, he adds, "nobody could enter the Gate to Hell without getting asphyxiated." (An incredibly old human fossil was recently found in a cave in Israel.)
