– A cold case in Maine about a teen who vanished nearly 40 years ago is getting a fresh look from police after his parents received an anonymous letter out of the blue Police are saying very little about the letter's contents, but they hope the author will reach out again and perhaps end the mystery of what happened to Bernard "Bunny" Ross, reports the Bangor Daily News Police say Ross, then 18, vanished on May 12, 1977, after taking the family car to his aunt's house in Presque Isle, then stealing another car near her home It was found about 20 miles away, and Ross has been a missing person since His parents—Bernard Sr., 80, and Carol, 78—say he'd been going through "ups and downs" at the time, but nothing out of the ordinary The letter writer claimed to have information about the disappearance, but police aren't divulging details Troy Gardner It's been the lack of resolution that's been so hard to deal with all these years, says Carol Ross “It’s not like there was a death It was the unknown," she says "There was always the hope that he’d walk through the door one day.” (A diligent mom helped crack a 10-year-old cold case about her daughter's killing.)
