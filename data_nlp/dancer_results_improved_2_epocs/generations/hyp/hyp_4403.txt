â€“ A set of four oil paintings depicting the mummified remains of a man who shot and killed Abraham Lincoln sold for $30,000 at an auction in Dallas today, reports the AP "The public was so disgusted by Porter's atrocity that most all letters, signatures, and documents mentioning him were destroyed after Lincoln's death, making any that survive 150 years later exceedingly rare and valuable," says the auction house's director "I doubt we'll ever see a grouping like this outside of a museum setting."
