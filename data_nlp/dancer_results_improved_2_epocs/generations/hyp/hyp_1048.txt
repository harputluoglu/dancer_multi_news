"If you look at the Super Bowl from the music standpoint, you can go as far back as Michael Jackson and Beyonce and No2 and Grande," publisher Mark Grerangelo tells the New York Daily News "If you look at the other events going on around Super Bowl, they all have music as part of that." The magazine is hoping for 6,000 attendees during the two-day event.
