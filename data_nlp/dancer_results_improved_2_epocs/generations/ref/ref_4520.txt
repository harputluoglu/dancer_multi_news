– "I think if we just remain deeply tasteful and just put deeply tasteful people on the cover, it would be a rather boring magazine!" That was Vogue editor Anna Wintour's response .. Or, as Fashionista puts it in its headline, "Anna Wintour Implies Kim and Kanye Are Not 'Tasteful.'" Of course, it could be argued she's "implying" the same thing about Madonna, since her answer started off: "I see the role of Vogue to reflect what’s going on in the culture The first celebrity that I put on the cover of Vogue was Madonna, and that was considered completely controversial at the time, too." If Vogue were to be too tasteful, Wintour continued during her talk at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art Monday night, "Nobody would talk about us It's very important that people do talk about us I hope another Kim Kardashian comes along this year!" (See how Kim's latest controversial magazine cover is contributing to divorce rumors.)
